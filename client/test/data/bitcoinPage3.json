      "title": "Japan Sees Surge In Gold Smuggling As Yakuza & Wealthy Chinese Team Up",
      "text": "In a story that was seemingly tailor-made for the tabloids, Japanese news agency Nikkei is reporting that, in an unusual but tantalizing example of financial symbiosis, *wealthy Chinese investors are teaming up with Yakuza gangsters to smuggle gold into Japan.* The payoff for each side is simple: Chinese investors, who are increasingly fearful that a depreciating yuan will create turbulence in local stock and bond markets, can circumvent China’s stringent capital controls and move their money out of the country. *And by cheating the Japanese government out of a consumption tax, the Yakuza stand to make a healthy profit.*\n\n\n\n“The argument goes that the rich, having lost confidence in the Chinese yuan and with investment in other assets becoming difficult, are turning to gold smuggling to move their wealth out of the country. *They supposedly hire mules to carry the gold from China, as well as places like South Korea and Taiwan, into Japan, where the consumption tax increase has made it easy for them to pay off the carriers and bribe staff at Asian airports.”*\n\n\n\nWhile Nikkei admits that its story is mostly based on hearsay, data show that a spike in demand for gold on the mainland has coincided with an increase in busts for gold smuggling by Japanese customs officials.\n\n\n\n“On the data side, *statistics from World Gold Council show that while global demand for gold used in jewelry and as an investment dropped 13.3% on the year in the three months through June, China's demand rose 7.8%.*\n\n\nOn the anecdote side, Chinese media outlet Shenyang Daily recently reported that 21 members of a gold smuggling gang had been discovered by customs officials in Shenyang, the largest city in Liaoning Province. *Six were arrested on suspicion of trying to smuggle 45kg of gold out of China, while several other members were caught in the early morning of March 21 at Shenyang's Taoxian International Airport carrying 37kg of gold. One member was sent back to Shenyang from Japan after being caught trying to smuggle in 8kg of gold in January.”*\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Nikkei reports that Japan is quickly becoming a popular destination for gold smugglers, as the number of cases has ballooned since the increase in Japan's consumption tax in April 2014 to 8% from 5%. While the tax hike has been a burden for consumers, it has proven to be a boon for criminals.\n\n\n\n“Japan is fast becoming the go-to place for gold smugglers. *According to data from the Finance Ministry, fines or other punishments were handed down for 177 gold smuggling cases in the year through June 2015. To put that into context, 2012 and 2013 each saw less than 10 cases punished.* The surge continued the following year, with the number of cases reaching an all-time high of 294 -- and this may be only the tip of the iceberg, as authorities believe there are numerous cases that have yet to come to light.”\n\n\n\nThe scam is relatively complex: With the cooperation of insider employees at budget airlines like Japan’s Vanilla Air, Japanese gangsters hide caches of gold aboard a given aircraft after it lands in China.\n\nThen they wait for the same plane to be used for a domestic flight, allowing them to carry the gold off the plane without risking being caught by customs officials. \n\nOnce the gold has been safely off-boarded, the smugglers sell it through a seemingly legitimate merchant, pocketing the consumption tax.\n\n\n\n“In Japan, consumption tax must be paid on gold when it is brought into the country. *This amount is later tacked onto the price of the gold when it is sold, passing the cost of the tax onto the buyer. By circumventing the initial taxation process, smugglers can make a \"profit\" equal to the amount of that tax. *Jacking up the consumption tax rate means bigger gains for smugglers.”\n\n\n\nJapanese officials say they’ve been surprised by the level of sophistication exhibited by the smugglers, adding that they appear to be backed by “big organizations” with “big funds.” *One recent case involved members of the Inagawa-kai, who were caught smuggling 112 kilos of gold into Japan from Macau using a private jet.*\n\n\n\n“The method using budget carriers really surprised us,\" a member of the Customs and Tariff Bureau said. *\"There was also a case in Saga Prefecture that used a method often used by drug smugglers, delivering gold by sea. Whoever is behind these cases is really putting a lot of thought into the process.\"*\n\n\nJapanese authorities suspect \"big organizations\" with \"big funds\" are carrying out the smuggling operations, hiring different people for different phases of the act. *Much of the blame falls on yakuza organized crime groups. A case in 2016 involved members related to the Inagawa-kai group who were prosecuted for smuggling 112kg of gold on their private jet from Macau. Finance Ministry statistics show that in 51% of the 294 cases that year, the perpetrators were Japanese.”*\n\n\n\n*If conditions in mainland China are any indication, incidences of gold smuggling will probably continue to rise. Early this year, the Communist Party tightened its capital controls, making it more difficult for wealthy individuals to move money offshore. *Chinese authorities have also forced bitcoin exchanges, long suspected of helping customers move money out of the country, to tighten their financial controls to ensure that their customers don't violate local financial regulations.\n\nIf there’s anything to be learned from the Nikkei report, it’s that Chinese investors are becoming increasingly desperate to move their money offshore.\n\nResorting to smuggling to move money offshore certainly doesn’t signal confidence in the country’s financial system.",

      "text": "This is a Trial Version of Social Share & Locker Pro plugin. Please add your purchase code into Licence section to enable the Full Social Share & Locker Pro Version. Bitfury Mines Segwit Block Larger Than 1MB as Bitcoiners Wait for Network Relief \nIt’s been well over 24-hours since Segregated Witness activated on the Bitcoin network, and cryptocurrency spectators have been watching to see if the protocol actually helps the network scale. Following Segwit activation, on August 25 at approximately 7:10 am UTC on block 481947 the mining pool Bitfury processed a block larger than 1MB. Bitfury Processes a Block Larger Than 1MB \nSegregated Witness (Segwit) is now live on the bitcoin network. During the first 24-hours of activity, some individual bitcoiners and companies began testing Segwit transactions. On August 24 some businesses like Trezor, Ledger Wallet and Openbazaar announced their wallets were “Segwit ready.” \nThen on August 25, software developer Justin Camarena, announced he crafted a transaction that led to a mined block over the 1MB block size limit. Block 481947 was 32KB larger than 1MB and confirmed 2164 transactions worth over $9M. Camarena works for the merchant Bitrefill and says the company sends these types of transactions all the time. He says if more businesses jumped on board with Segwit transactions people would see a difference. \n“We’re a merchant, we have these [types of transactions] all the time,” explains Camarena. “Very similar to exchanges, except they have more outputs depending on how they do it. But yeah, if only a few more moved to segwit we’d get the ball rolling.” \nWe received all those as incoming payments, and I aggregate them to another wallet in low fee periods. All further aggregations at Bitrefill.com will be with Segwit as will all incoming payments. Segwit Criticisms Begin Just 24-Hours After Activation \nSegwit is here, but not everyone is cracking bottles of champagne as many are waiting for the technical merits of this protocol to show its worth. Currently, the Bitcoin network’s transaction queue (mempool) is pretty backed up with 60,000 to 80,000 unconfirmed transactions at the time of writing. \nBecause of the backlog, the average fastest and cheapest transaction (tx) fee on the network is currently 510 satoshis/byte , or over $5 per bitcoin tx. This has caused many skeptical discussions concerning the merits of Segwit relieving network congestion. On August 24 bitcoin developer Jeff Garzik writes to his followers on Twitter ; \nBitcoin per-transaction fees, with Segwit active: – Average $7.14, – Median $4.16. \nCriticisms like these have led to responses from Segwit supporters that it will “take time” to get to 1.7MB transaction throughput. Timeframes discussed have been months or even a year to see the upgrade take full effect as every wallet developer would have to “Segwit ready” their wallets, and most users will have to update wallet software as well. Forums are littered with posts about unconfirmed transactions and high fees. \nAccording to the Bitcoincore.org website allegedly over 80 businesses stated they were “Segwit ready” months ago, 29 companies said they were in the midst of working on it, and 27 bitcoin-based organizations said they planned to integrate the protocol. Whether or not these companies utilize Segwit-based transactions is an entirely different story. Moreover, some bitcoin proponents are saying in order to see actual lower fees and faster throughput, the bitcoin ‘community’ might have to wait even longer until the Lightning Network is ready. \nWhat do you think about the first 24-hours of Segwit activation? Do you think users need to be patient and wait and see if the protocol delivers? Let us know in the comments below. \nImages via Shutterstock, r/bitcoin, and Twitter. ",

Just this morning, the price surged above the $4,400 mark again after dropping below $3,000 several times over the last seven days. \nOver the past week, however, the price of bitcoin is up 7%, according to data from the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), and it’s now up 68% month-over-month. \nThe steady uptick has come at a time when the rising prices of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has pushed the collective market capitalization for those networks to new heights as well. \nTwo days ago, the overall market cap climbed above $150 billion for the first time, according to data provider CoinMarketCap, and today the market was hovering near all-time highs. \nAt publication, the total value of all cryptocurrencies was $153 billion. \nBalloon image via Shutterstock The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies .

      "text": "(Before It's News)\nAuthored by Mac Slavo via SHTFplan.com,\nLast month Alt-Market.com founder Brandon Smith warned that Bitcoin may not be all that it’s cracked up to be in terms of its purported anonymity :\nFor years, one of the major original selling points of bitcoin was that it was “ anonymous .” It always surprised me that so many people in the liberty movement bought into this scam.\nSurely after the revelations exposed by Edward Snowden and organizations like Wikileaks, it is utterly foolish to believe that anything in the digital world is truly “anonymous.”\nThe feds have been proving there is no anonymity , even in bitcoin, for some time, as multiple arrests using bitcoin tracking have indeed occurred when the FBI decided it was in their interest. Meaning, when the feds want to track bitcoin transactions , they can, and it does not matter how well the people involved covered their actions.\nBecause every transaction exists on a public blockchain ledger, an enterprising organization – say like the NSA or IRS – could conceivably implement blockchain analysis tools to track down Bitcoin fund transfers around the globe. These days most bitcoin transactions are originated on “trusted” exchanges that exist in Western nations, where governments have always found new and innovative ways to ensure citizens have no privacy whatsoever, especially when it comes to personal finances. This means that there is more than likely a record of your original Bitcoin transaction, perhaps involving a credit card or bank transfer, and if regulators ask an exchange to turn over the information you can bet they’ll do so in order to avoid unwanted government scrutiny. Moreover, most exchanges now require a driver’s license, passport and even a phone number in order to approve your account for trading.\nThe point is, for government investigators with a bone to pick, your crypto currency activities online may not be as anonymous and private as you may think.\nIn fact, so exposed is the blockchain to Big Brother monitoring and interference, that the Internal Revenue Service has now implemented blockchain analysis tools to help them track down individuals who are profiting off the crypto currency and not declaring these profits on their tax returns.\nVia Bitcoin.com :\nAccording to a contract recently obtained by the Daily Beast, the IRS can now track bitcoin and other cryptocurrency addresses. They can do this to route out potential tax evaders. They purchased software from the blockchain analysis group Chainalysis .\nThe document details that “criminals” have used digital currencies to launder money, deal drugs, and commit other unlawful behavior. However, criminals have also been using digital currencies to ignore tax liabilities and evade responsibility. The Daily Beast article elaborated:\nThe document highlights how law enforcement isn’t only concerned with criminals accumulating bitcoin from selling drugs or hacking targets, but also those who use the currency to hide wealth or avoid paying taxes.\nReason for IRS Crackdown; Tracking Bitcoiners\nThe reason the IRS is cracking down on digital currencies appears to be because only 802 people declared bitcoin profits or losses in 2015. The Daily Beast article suggests that many people may have not expected the IRS to collect on digital currencies. Others may have just thought they could easily sidestep this alleged obligation.\nAs a result of this failure to pay taxes, the IRS consulted with Chainalysis.\nThey are now providing the IRS with tools to track bitcoin addresses through the blockchain and centralized exchanges. A Fortune article captured a screen shot of the letter:\nThe tool that Chainaylsis gave the IRS is called a refactor tool. It visualizes, tracks, and analysis transactions on the blockchain. Agencies from law enforcement, IRS, and banks will be able to use the tool , according to sources.\nTo date, records show the IRS has paid Chainaylsis $88,700 since 2015 for its services.\nTax Evaders and “Criminals” are Adapting; Coinbase Case Chainalysis\nEven though the IRS and companies such as Chainalysis are starting to hunt down blockchain users for evading taxes, enterprising individuals are adapting. They are now starting to use blockchains and cryptocurrencies that undermine current analytic techniques. For instance, the Wannacry hacker group supposedly moved their funds over into Monero to evade detection by law enforcement. Other crypto users may decide to use Zcash, which also employs more private and anonymous transaction measures.\nIn the past, the IRS has used multiple outlets to capture tax evaders using bitcoin. They have already tried to legally force Coinbase to hand over customer information. Currently, it looks like Coinbase may surrender customer data for those who exchanged over $20,000 worth of bitcoin on the platform. No telling what the court will rule in the end. News.Bitcoin.com covered the case in June:\nThe IRS will no longer target a wide-range of Coinbase users via its information request, which it filed on Coinbase back in March. Instead, the agency made concessions to seek account data of individuals who transacted — meaning they bought, sold, sent, or received — $20,000 worth of bitcoin in any transaction type.\nFull article at bitcoin.com\nPrepare for a full-out onslaught against the government’s newest enemy: crypto terrorists.\nThat means YOU, if you happen to own any Bitcoin.\nBecause as we highlighted in 2014, under new directives passed by the Obama Administration, concrete facts are not necessary for you to be put on any number of government watch lists :\nThe recently declassified Watchlisting Guidance rule book issued in 2013 and developed by members of 19 law enforcement agencies that include the FBI, NSA, CIA, and NSA, outlines the rules for placing individuals, including American citizens, on the various watch lists currently in use. As noted by The Intercept , the rules, much like America’s secretive anti-terrorism laws, are vague and often contradict each other.\nIt reveals a confounding and convoluted system filled with exceptions to its own rules, and it relies on the elastic concept of “reasonable suspicion” as a standard for determining whether someone is a possible threat.\nBecause the government tracks “suspected terrorists” as well as “known terrorists,” individuals can be watchlisted if they are suspected of being a suspected terrorist, or if they are suspected of associating with people who are suspected of terrorism activity.\n“Instead of a watchlist limited to actual, known terrorists, the government has built a vast system based on the unproven and flawed premise that it can predict if a person will commit a terrorist act in the future,” says Hina Shamsi, the head of the ACLU’s National Security Project. “On that dangerous theory, the government is secretly blacklisting people as suspected terrorists and giving them the impossible task of proving themselves innocent of a threat they haven’t carried out.”\nThe guidelines for who is or is not a terrorist are now so vague that any American could potentially be added to a list for something as menial as knowing someone who has committed an activity deemed to be of terrorist nature. And as has been highlighted previously, those activities could range from making a hand gesture that looks like a gun or manufacturing your own gold and silver coins .\nAnd now, of course, trading or owning Bitcoin.\nSource: http://silveristhenew.com/2017/08/25/is-bitcoin-really-anonymous-irs-moves-to-track-cryptocurrencies-with-new-chain-analysis-tools/",

      "text": "BTC Holder: Have You Claimed Your Stellar Lumens Yet? August 27th Deadline Approaches 4 hours ago 72 in cryptocurrency \nI helped someone claim their Stellar Lumens tonight and wondered if my Steemit followers have claimed theirs as well. If you owned Bitcoin or Ripple as of a specific date (and still have access to those private keys so you can sign a message), then you can claim some Stellar Lumens (XLM) based on their distribution described in detail here: https://www.stellar.org/blog/bitcoin-claim-lumens-2/ \nIf you're thinking about doing this, you need to hurry because the deadline is August 27th . \nAlso, much like Steemit did early on, they authenticate with Facebook as part of the process, so that might put some people off. \nIf you already did this, you can check your balance at the stellar laboratory . \nIf you're looking for a local wallet to keep your Stellar, I installed the wallet from Github and it seems to work great. \nI now have a nice little chunk of XLM, and I think I'll hold on to it a bit and see what happens after August 27th. Is it possible the distribution up this point has kept the price low? Could the price rise as the supply/demand curve changes? I'm interested in finding out. Here's the price info right now: \nIf you have your bitcoin on a paper wallet, this post can help: Step By Step: Getting Your Bitcoin Cash out of a Bitcoin Paper Wallet . It's the same basic process here in that you import your private key into Electrum and then you can sign the message they ask you to sign in order to claim your XLM. \nIf you're already going through this process, you may want to look into Byteball as well. The next distirbution is in 11 days on September 6th: https://byteball.org/ \nI hope you found this useful! Let me know if you've claimed your Stellar and what you plan to do it with, if you're going to hold or sell. \nOh, also, while we're talking various cryptocurrencies, if you're looking for a way to manage your holdings you may find my Cryptocurrency Bank Spreadsheet from 5 months ago useful.

      "title": "Why I sold half of my bitcoin ⋅ Bitcoin Link",
      "text": "Bitcoin Link I'm only sharing this because I suspect many other people struggle with this decision and what is \"the right thing to do\". I will surely end up regretting this decision, but then my life is littered with regret over making bad investment decisions at the wrong time. However, any regret I might feel is tempered by some peace of mind I have gained back. The simple answer why I sold half of my bitcoin? Because I had risked more than I was willing to lose. It's truly as simple as that. I have seen my paper bitcoin profit rise by over 400%. Both the current value of that investment combined with the amount I had originally invested was enough money that, were I to lose it all, it would be extremely painful. Meanwhile, while holding this large paper profit, I had an equal amount of unsecured debt in the form of home improvements/repairs previously financed and my children's student loans. By selling half of my bitcoin, I was able to completely pay off 100% of my adult children's student loan debt, something which was weighing them down heavily as they try to start their lives. It is a great relief and gift to be able to give them this fresh start. In addition to paying off this unsecured debt I was also able to pocket substantial profit such that the remaining bitcoin I still hold has a cost basis of essentially zero. All I can lose now is paper profit, but I will always be able to say I made a great return on my bitcoin investment and helped improve the lives of my kids substantially. Now that my remaining bitcoin has a cost basis of zero, it's much easier to let it ride indefinitely. If bitcoin ever does 'go to the moon' I will still do very, very, well. But if it has a massive price correction I can accept that much more easily. Frankly Bitcoin is still a very risky investment. With threats of hard-forks and threats from the state, there are no long term guarantees. I also did it for another reason. Because I had money at risk, certainly more than I was willing to lose, I was finding that I was feeling undue stress and anxiety about the bitcoin price roller coaster and that wasn't helping. This post is not to convince any hodler to sell, ever. However, for those who are sitting on long-term paper profits and feeling high anxiety about it, maybe my story offers something​ to think about. **edit** This is the first time I have sold any since October 2013.

      "title": "Is Bitcoin Really Anonymous? IRS Moves To Track Cryptocurrencies With New Chain Analysis Tools",
      "text": "Authored by Mac Slavo via SHTFplan.com, \nLast month Alt-Market.com founder Brandon Smith warned that Bitcoin may not be all that it’s cracked up to be in terms of its purported anonymity : \nFor years, one of the major original selling points of bitcoin was that it was “ anonymous .” It always surprised me that so many people in the liberty movement bought into this scam. \n\nSurely after the revelations exposed by Edward Snowden and organizations like Wikileaks, it is utterly foolish to believe that anything in the digital world is truly “anonymous.” \n\nThe feds have been proving there is no anonymity , even in bitcoin, for some time, as multiple arrests using bitcoin tracking have indeed occurred when the FBI decided it was in their interest. Meaning, when the feds want to track bitcoin transactions , they can, and it does not matter how well the people involved covered their actions. \nBecause every transaction exists on a public blockchain ledger, an enterprising organization – say like the NSA or IRS – could conceivably implement blockchain analysis tools to track down Bitcoin fund transfers around the globe. These days most bitcoin transactions are originated on “trusted” exchanges that exist in Western nations, where governments have always found new and innovative ways to ensure citizens have no whatsoever, especially when it comes to personal finances. This means that there is more than likely a record of your original Bitcoin transaction, perhaps involving a credit card or bank transfer, and if regulators ask an exchange to turn over the information you can bet they’ll do so in order to avoid unwanted government scrutiny. Moreover, most exchanges now require a driver’s license, passport and even a phone number in order to approve your account for trading. \nThe point is, for government investigators with a bone to pick, your crypto currency activities online may not be as anonymous and private as you may think. \nIn fact, so exposed is the blockchain to Big Brother monitoring and interference, that the Internal Revenue Service has now implemented blockchain analysis tools to help them track down individuals who are profiting off the crypto currency and not declaring these profits on their tax returns. \nVia Bitcoin.com : \nAccording to a contract recently obtained by the Daily Beast, the IRS can now track bitcoin and other cryptocurrency addresses. They can do this to route out potential tax evaders. They purchased software from the blockchain analysis group Chainalysis . \nThe document details that “criminals” have used digital currencies to launder money, deal drugs, and commit other unlawful behavior. However, criminals have also been using digital currencies to ignore tax liabilities and evade responsibility. The Daily Beast article elaborated: \nThe document highlights how law enforcement isn’t only concerned with criminals accumulating bitcoin from selling drugs or hacking targets, but also those who use the currency to hide wealth or avoid paying taxes. \nReason for IRS Crackdown; Tracking Bitcoiners \n\nThe reason the IRS is cracking down on digital currencies appears to be because only 802 people declared bitcoin profits or losses in 2015. The Daily Beast article suggests that many people may have not expected the IRS to collect on digital currencies. Others may have just thought they could easily sidestep this alleged obligation. \nAs a result of this failure to pay taxes, the IRS consulted with Chainalysis. \n\nThey are now providing the IRS with tools to track bitcoin addresses through the blockchain and centralized exchanges. A Fortune article captured a screen shot of the letter: \n\n\nThe tool that Chainaylsis gave the IRS is called a refactor tool. It visualizes, tracks, and analysis transactions on the blockchain. Agencies from law enforcement, IRS, and banks will be able to use the tool , according to sources. \n\nTo date, records show the IRS has paid Chainaylsis $88,700 since 2015 for its services. \n\nPrepare for a full-out onslaught against the government’s newest enemy: crypto terrorists. \nThat means YOU, if you happen to own any Bitcoin. \nBecause as we highlighted in 2014, under new directives passed by the Obama Administration, concrete facts are not necessary for you to be put on any number of government watch lists : \nThe recently declassified Watchlisting Guidance rule book issued in 2013 and developed by members of 19 law enforcement agencies that include the FBI, NSA, CIA, and NSA, outlines the rules for placing individuals, including American citizens, on the various watch lists currently in use. As noted by The Intercept , the rules, much like America’s secretive anti-terrorism laws, are vague and often contradict each other. \nIt reveals a confounding and convoluted system filled with exceptions to its own rules, and it relies on the elastic concept of “reasonable suspicion” as a standard for determining whether someone is a possible threat. \n\nBecause the government tracks “suspected terrorists” as well as “known terrorists,” individuals can be watchlisted if they are suspected of being a suspected terrorist, or if they are suspected of associating with people who are suspected of terrorism activity. \n\n“Instead of a watchlist limited to actual, known terrorists, the government has built a vast system based on the unproven and flawed premise that it can predict if a person will commit a terrorist act in the future,” says Hina Shamsi, the head of the ACLU’s National Security Project. “On that dangerous theory, the government is secretly blacklisting people as suspected terrorists and giving them the impossible task of proving themselves innocent of a threat they haven’t carried out.” \nThe guidelines for who is or is not a terrorist are now so vague that any American could potentially be added to a list for something as menial as knowing someone who has committed an activity deemed to be of terrorist nature. And as has been highlighted previously, those activities could range from making a hand gesture that looks like a gun or manufacturing your own gold and silver coins . \nAnd now, of course, trading or owning Bitcoin.

      "text": "How to buy Bitcoin: Crypto currency making a comeback with investors The Courier-Mail August 26, 2017 9:11am \nEVER wondered what $50,000 looks like in cash, gold and silver? \nWhile piles of $100 notes or ingots of silver might make the money hungry salivate, the equivalent value in gold is a paltry #g bar and almost doesn’t seem worth acknowledging. \nBut spare a thought for those who invest their hard-earned money in an item that delivers even less of a visible return but which has rapidly grown in popularity around the world: Bitcoin. \nA $50,000 “piece” of the crypto currency is rendered physically as a mere printout of a QR code on a piece of card. Hardly inspiring stuff. \nYet, the way Australians invest their hard-earned cash seems to be changing. More and more seem to be moving away from traditional financial investments and money options and choosing alternative forms of currency such as Bitcoin – which has undergone a recent surge in value – as well as the classic gold and silver bullion. \nOver the past 12 months, according to the Independent Reserve exchange, the use of alternative currencies has grown by 600 per cent and this increase was further cemented when the Federal government recently announced it would place legislation in to remove “double dipping of GST” on Bitcoin. media_camera Gold bullion is regarded as a safe-haven investment. Picture: Hollie Adams/The Australian \nBrisbane company Ainslie Bullion has just rewritten its 43-year business history to reflect this change and recently became the first in Australia to buy and sell both Bitcoin and bullion. \nAinslie director Paul Engeman said many of his clients chose Bitcoin or bullion because they wanted to diversify their portfolio away from traditional financial investment options. \n“Bitcoin and other crypto currencies are an emerging form of alternative money and investment \nclass,” he said. “Their popularity is growing as more and more people lose faith in fiat currencies, financial institutions and debt inflated financial markets. \n“As crypto currency continues to grow and become seen as a strong alternative, we feel the two – precious metal bullion and crypto – go hand-in-hand in providing investors with a balanced option. \n“While gold has a 5,000-year history and Bitcoin has a 10-year history, these two forms of money have many similarities and actually work well together. In fact, it’s common to see Bitcoin even represented visually as a gold coin. \n“Bitcoin and gold should not be viewed as mutually exclusive assets and by using them in tandem, an individual can build a portfolio that provides for long-term financial stability.” \nAnd it’s not just technically astute millennials who are jumping on the Bitcoin bandwagon. Mr Engeman said the clients buying bullion and Bitcoin could range from tradies and high school teachers to even baby boomers who invest via their self-managed super fund (SMSF). \n“SMSF’s have been the largest customer category growth in bullion purchases over the past few \nyears,” Mr Engeman said. “Given the similarities, I’m not surprised Bitcoin sales have been \ndominated by this group as well.” \nMr Engeman said both Bitcoin and bullion have intrinsic value through rarity. \n“Gold requires a tonne of rock to be mined and processed to get about two grams of product, which means supply grows at only 2 per cent a year,” he said. “Likewise, there are only 21 million bitcoins that will ever be in existence, and the digital mining required to produce them takes cost, time and effort. \n“Another similarity between the two is that gold and silver are traditionally one of the very few \ninvestment classes that are uncorrelated to traditional financial markets. Gold tends to be a safe-haven investment that increases in value as financial markets decrease. There is growing evidence that crypto is becoming another form of safe-haven investment.” \nAs part of the set-up process, Ainslie Bullion engaged Lucas Cullen who is Brisbane’s leading expert on Bitcoin and runs the Bitcoin Brisbane user group. \n“It’s a complicated product and not many experts in the space,” Mr Cullen said. “Ainslie now provide a safe and easy platform for people wanting to get into Bitcoin or wanting to use Bitcoin to diversify. \n“The proof is in the pudding, just look at the price of Bitcoin over time. The numbers don’t lie, no matter your opinion of the technology.” ",

      "text": "Browse: Home Mainstream Bitcoin The ABC’S Of Bitcoin And Everything You Need To Know About “Forks” The ABC’S Of Bitcoin And Everything You Need To Know About “Forks” Published by on August 26, 2017 | Comments Off on The ABC’S Of Bitcoin And Everything You Need To Know About “Forks” \nAidan Bartos \n99% of Cryptocurrencies are total scams. And, yes, Cryptocurrencies are in a bubble. \nBUT…the opportunity is NEVER going away and generational wealth will be made. So you have to know the basics, why this opportunity even exists and what to watch out for. \nHere’s the problem. There’s around 900 different cryptocurrencies that exist, with new ones being created every week. \nI can tell you for sure: 95% of the cryptocurrencies are scams or Ponzi schemes. And I get questions every day: “Is XYZ currency a scam?” And nobody listens to the answer. \nEveryone is convinced they are right. That’s a bad sign. I always tell myself I’m the dumbest person in the room. Then I call the smarter people and ask them lots of questions. And then I read everything I can. And in this case, I read the code. \nBut the opportunity is immense. Think, “Internet 1994”. Right before the “right before”. \nBC will stand for “Before Crypto” and AC will stand for “After Crypto”. We are in AC right now and the world is about to change. \nI’ve never written about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies before. But there’s a reason I want to start now. \nWe’re in a hype bubble. \nIt doesn’t mean cryptos or bad. It doesn’t mean you shouldn’t buy. It just means….there’s a lot of hype and scammers out there. We’ve seen this story at least twice before in past 20 years and many people have gotten hurt. \nI’ve been actively involved in investing in Cryptocurrencies since 2013 (I sold my book, “Choose Yourself” in a Bitcoin-only store I created a month before I released it on Amazon). And for the past 18 months I’ve participated in various ICOs (Internet Coin Offerings) that are all doing well. \nI say this just to establish some credentials. I will be writing more frequently about cryptocurrencies simply because I see so many people I know starting to be hurt when, in fact, there’s opportunities to make a lot of money in the space. Big picture: \nA simple cryptocurrency transaction looks like this: \nA) James wants to send Joe 10 bitcoin. \nB) James has 100 bitcoins that he has gotten from 500 people who, in turn, got from 10,000 people, and on and on back to the very first bitcoin transaction. \nC) James puts together a “transaction” (technically complicated but simply described as a “transaction”) and sends it out onto the block chain. \nD) A “block” is a list of transactions. \nE) enough “miners” confirm that the transactions in a block are legit (all of the inputs are legit and all of the outputs are legit. The merchant (in this case, “Joe” ) can decide how much validation he needs. \nF) the bitcoins get transferred \nEvery step above is much more complicated, but for a reason. Pros and Cons: \nA) a standardized and neutral confirmation policy backed by software that has no human agendas. \nWhat does this mean? \nImagine I want to send Joe dollars to buy his house. I need to trust all of the middlemen between Joe and me: local bank, central bank, lawyers, governments, Joe’s bank, etc to approve of this transaction if I do it in dollars. \nThis is ok but at each step someone can be untrustworthy. They are all humans, even the government (humans subtly influence the price of the dollar and also share details of the transaction with unfriendly parties (the IRS)). \nAlso, each step in the above has a transaction cost. So inflation is built into the system. \nIf this were a bitcoin transaction, enough miners need to approve that this transaction is valid. So even if a few miners are not trustworthy, the bulk of them will be and we can trust that the transaction between me and Joe is legit. \n[This process is complicated. Suffice to say, it works on Bitcoin and any other “legit” cryptocurrency.] \nThis is the ENTIRE reason for cryptocurrency: avoid governments, borders, middlemen, extra transaction costs. As well as have high security and avoid forgery. \n(there is another reason for cryptocurrency, which is to do more complicated transactions that we can call “contracts” without lawyers, etc. This reason is sometimes the basis for legit ICOs). \nImagine the history of money. Money is used as a store of value OR as a way to transact without having to use a barter system. Store of Value \nFirst it was the land you owned and the resources you developed on that land (wheat, grains, etc). \nThen it was metals. Gold, silver, etc. You traveled with it by fashioning it into jewelry. Too much gold = harder to travel. \nPaper currency. Backed first by gold but then…faith in God (“in God we trust”) or government. (Or a pyramid…with an eye in it????) \nElectronic currency. Easily transportable. But transaction fees all over the system. Zero privacy. \nAnd the next generation is Cryptocurrency. Easily transportable, little to zero transaction fees, no human intervention between payor and payee, high anonymity, and even functionality. \nMoney evolves, like anything else, and the natural evolution of money is always as a store of value that is easier to move, more secure, and more private. Transactions \nTransactions have the same history. And the same issues. How can you transact across a far geographic area with less fees, less costs, less chance for human error, higher security and privacy. \nA natural evolution leads go crypto-currency. THE BIGGEST TREND: \nTheism: A country planning on going to war would make sacrifices to their gods. Would pray. And would surrender to the fact that whosever god was stronger would win. \nHumanism: More people, more bullets, more human intelligence, equals the winner in a war. \nData-ism: This is the war being fought every day right now. We saw tiny snapshot of it with the election but it’s only a snapshot in a ten year long movie. \nThe war is on every single day. It’s fought in every country. It’s fought with data and hacking and piracy. \nMEDICINE: \nTheism: Shamans and priests would pray for health or do rituals to enhance health. \nHumanism: The doctor knocks your knee, puts hand on head, take two aspiring and call me in the morning \nData-ism: Bloodwork, DNA work, robotic surgeries, fMRIs, Catscans. Statistical matching with massive database of similar scans to do diagnosis. All medicine is starting to be outsourced to data. \nCURRENCY: \nTheism: “In God We Trust” \nHumanism: Let’s throw a President on there. Let’s get the signature of the Secretary of Treasury up there. “Don’t worry, we’re good for it.” While we print a few trillion without telling anyone. \nData-ism: The natural evolution: Cryptocurrency. \nDoes this mean Bitcoin is “The winner”. Buy bitcoin? \nNo. It just means the natural evolution of currency is arriving and nothing will stop it. \nThe basic philosophy is: \n– Decentralized. So no one government entity can quietly mint money for their own purposes and have access to your transactions, accounts, etc. \n– Security. So nobody can forge or steal your money. \n– Privacy. Your transactions can’t be seen and reported to other entitles. \n– Functionality. This is the more technical parts of the blockchain in Cryptocurrencies but suffice to say some of the “intrinsic value” of a coin is the functionality and computational power used to “mine” that functionality. \nThere’s not going to be ONE winner. \nJust like there is not one paper currency (or metal currency). There’s dollars, Euros, pesos. \nThe difference is: those currencies have geographic borders. \nCryptocurrencies have “use” borders. ZCash might be used by people requiring higher anonymity. Filecoin might be used by people requiring decentralized storage. Dash might be used be people requiring faster transactions. \nThe borders are created when more problems are solved. Which is a true innovation for currency. \nAs opposed to borders (and supply) being created by geographic boundaries, central banks with secret control, or a gold mine down the block. \nTHE BAD: \nWith Bitcoin, a list of transactions is sent out to the network in the form of a “block”. Miners, who are slowly paid in more bitcoin up to a maximum of 21,000,000 validate a transaction. \nIf a transaction doesn’t make it into a block (on Bitcoin) it waits a certain period of time to get into the next block. \nThis means it might take more time (a problem). \nAnother problem is that everyone can “see” the transaction on what is called the blockchain. They can’t see who it was but they can see the size and other details. (a problem). \nSometimes software can provide a solution (a coffee shop can say, I’ll verify the transaction anyway and trust that in ten minutes I’ll know for sure and there’s not a lot of risk in this). \nBut a software layer involves humans and human error and human “evil”. Hence there are scammers and Ponzi scheme and theft (just like with paper currencies). \nThe good news is these are problems that can be eliminated. \nJust like Internet software since 1991 solved (although always improving) the problems of speed, security, transactions, privacy, more functionality, etc think of cryptocurrencies as the “Internet of Money”. \nThese problems are being solved. \nEither with new currencies (examples: Ether, Dash, filecoin, etc) some of which may be scam currencies, others may be legit. Time and research will tell (just like with the Internet in 1995)…OR with “forks” in currencies, like what is happening today with Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. SO WHAT IS BITCOIN CASH AND WHAT SHOULD I DO? \nBitcoin Cash tries to solve the problem of how can I buy a cup of coffee with bitcoin without using the software layer of Bitcoin. \nRemember, if a transaction doesn’t make it onto a block that is then sent out into the network to be validated, it has to wait. \nBitcoin Cash is simply the same as Bitcoin, except it increases the size of a block from 1MB to 8MB. Hence, faster transactions. \nThe reason that many exchanges are nervous about this “hard fork” is: \nA) it’s never happened before. So there could be the possibility that smart developers can find a flaw in the process and steal money. \nB) A “fork” is similar to a human election. We had a choice between Clinton and Trump and forked to Trump (not an exact analogy but rough). \nBitcoin is designed to limit human involvement as much as possible because all humans have different agendas. \nFor instance, perhaps China is greatly in favor of Bitcoin Cash because they currently have a huge edge on mining and they will be able to amass a large amount of Bitcoin Cash before others can. \nSo the fallout of Bitcoin Cash, while probably correct philosophically and from a software point of view, is still unclear from a human point of view. \nSame for the development of any new cryptocurrency (although all new currencies need scrutiny on the software side as well). But this fork is a bit more intense because Bitcoin is so big and it’s the first time this has happened. \nThis leads immediately to some logical conclusions: \nWhat to do right now about Bitcoin Cash and August 1: \nA) remove your bitcoin wallet from exchanges and store it in cold storage. If you google “cold storage” you can see step by step how to do that. \nB) If Bitcoin crashes 20% over the next few days because of this fork, I’d be a buyer. The philosophy of Bitcoin remains the same, it’s still the biggest, and volatility only creates opportunity. \nC) If Bitcoin Cash goes up too much, I’d sell or sell short, only because we don’t really know how people should value it. \nCryptocurrencies are going to be volatile for awhile. So in addition to the basic opportunity (Cryptocurrencies taking over all currencies) there is many additional trading opportunities due to the volatility. \nFirst, back to the basics: Why does volatility create opportunity? \nBecause it’s rare that intrinsic value changes very quickly from day to day. \nExample: We know everything there is to know about McDonalds and 1000s of analysts research the company. \nThe intrinsic value of McDonald’s will almost certainly never go down 20% in a day. But if the stock went down 20% in a day (example: a 9/11 event occurs causing a mass fear selloff across all stocks), then MCD becomes a value buy because the volatility exceeded the normal change in value. \nIf you can identify the Cryptocurrencies that are legitimate and not scams, then you can make a lot of money playing in volatile situations in Cryptocurrencies. Conclusion: \nA) Cryptocurrency philosophy is valid and not going anywhere and is a natural evolution in: \na. the history of money from bartering to coins to paper money to data money \nb. the history of every industry from theism to humanism to data-ism. \nB) Volatility is huge as people determine what coins are real and what aren’t. \nThese are the basics. \nI wrote these basics around the circumstances of the event happening today: The bitcoin fork. \nBut I also want to begin helping the many people who are being scammed by all sorts of schemes and layers of schemes that are trying to dupe people into buying or trading cryptocurrencies that can be potentially worse than giant Madoff schemes. \nThe evolution of money, and the evolution of every industry, strongly imply that Cryptocurrencies, probably in many forms, will be in our future. And will dominate the money supply at some point. \nAnd how we get from “here” to “there” will be paved with many lucrative opportunities. \nBut I was burned plenty this type of opportunity in the 90s and in the 00s and I don’t plan on doing so again. The solution is research, diversification, building a network of intelligence people who understand all the relevant issues, and then making smart allocation decisions. \nIf you like this article and would like more on Cryptocurrencies you can let me know in the comments.",

      "text": "Mr. Smith hackers reveal end of 'Game of Thrones' season 7 August 26, 2017 - 14:38   The so-called Mr. Smith hacking group that's responsible for stealing approximately 1.5 terabytes of data from HBO havereleased what they're calling the sixth wave of leaks — and it just so happens this data dump contains what they claim is the end to Season 7 of \"Game of Thrones\" , Mashable reveals. \nThe confidential plot summaries and outlines appear to provide, in exact detail, just how this season will end. Mashable said it has read the confidential summary, but has chosen not to publish the explicit details in this post. \nThe hackers have demanded approximately $6.5 million worth of Bitcoin from HBO, which so far has seemed at least partially willing to negotiate with the group. Apparently, however, that wasn't enough for the Mr. Smith hacking group. \n\"We know exactly what HBO and shoemakers around are doing now,\" the group told Mashable in an emailed statement. \"Unlike HBO, we never getting surprised. Pattern analysis of HBO's silly hidden acts are as we expected. We eagerly waiting for Fireye's report ... tell them to hurry up.\" Related links:",

      "text": "Browse: Home Mainstream Bitcoin Bitcoin Cannot Go To Zero Bitcoin Cannot Go To Zero Published by on August 26, 2017 | Comments Off on Bitcoin Cannot Go To Zero I am a relatively conservative and risk averse investor. As I look at the rise of Bitcoin, I often find myself thinking about one thing: risk. I am willing to speculate in some cases, and I also am willing to invest to learn more about an opportunity. I have come to feel that Bitcoin is far less speculative and more conservative than most people think. While others get greedy and see Bitcoin as a perfect investment opportunity, I think about how investing in Bitcoin could kill my capital. Buffett rings in my mind at these times: Rule #1 – Never lose money. Rule #2 – Never forget rule #1. But perhaps there is another way to think about the risk? Perhaps there is a floor? Perhaps I can apply rational thought and some second level thinking to Bitcoin. It’s time to look deeper. First, let’s look at a quick chart: ( Source ) The gains are tremendous in just one year. Investing in Bitcoin with Coinbase isn’t difficult. And, the proof is in the pudding for those who got in even in the last month or two . In short, timing has been everything. If you got in at the right time, the gains were there for you. But what about right now? What about today? If you’re a conservative investor, is there anything to help mitigate the risk? The First Clue That Bitcoin Might Not Completely Collapse I used to think that Bitcoin could suddenly go to zero. I highly doubt that now, which I’ll explain in a minute. First, here’s a look at Bitcoin’s Market Cap: \n( Source ) The point is that the overall Bitcoin market cap is $80B. And, adoption is growing like a weed. It’s likely that more than 10 million people own some Bitcoin. There are 2.8 million people who own Bitcoin in the U.S. That means to close to 1% of all U.S. citizens own some Bitcoin . Clearly, that’s not a critical mass in terms of holdings, but it points to growing awareness. Aunt Bessie might have heard “Bitcoin” by now. And, your next door neighbor might bring it up in passing to you at the community pool. The point is that awareness is likely significantly higher than 1% in the United States. I can’t speculate as to how many people who are aware will become buyers, or investors, or holders – but there is the rough logic that says some will. It’s Called a Cryptocurrency for a Reason If we think about Bitcoin being a technology for a moment, the Technology Adoption Curve takes on special meaning in relation to Bitcoin adoption: ( Source ) \n“In the beginning, innovators are the first to get interested on new products and novelties. They even accept incomplete or defective products just for the pleasure of being the first ones to use this new product. In second place we find the early adopters, also known as visionaries or enthusiasts, who accept the risks of testing new products, but not for the pleasure of coming first but because they the potential in it. Usually, they are influencers within organizations and communities in which they participate.” Since we are still in the early adoption phase of Bitcoin, we can realistically say that early adopters haven’t even really jumped in yet. In other words, unless an outside force comes along and crushes Bitcoin, adoption is certain to move upward . And, of course, as the technology is adopted, the value of Bitcoin increases, because the technology is the currency. Here’s the important point: Even if Bitcoin doesn’t surge forward due to adoption, it’s still likely to maintain its value at some level. That level of value is some place above zero and perhaps well above zero. That means that I don’t see a sudden bankruptcy of Bitcoin, which is one measurement of safety. None of this is to say that Bitcoin value will be stable , or that Bitcoin won’t be replaced eventually. But there is unlikely to be an abrupt, catastrophic drop to zero value, and that’s where I like to start as a conservative investor. I also believe that if we think of Bitcoin as technology, the S-Curve means even better days are ahead. That’s because if only 1% of the U.S. holds Bitcoin, then there’s an ocean of opportunity… 99% haven’t adopted yet. Even a small percentage of adoption amounts to many millions more buyers, users, and holders of Bitcoin. Inverting this logic, we have more risk mitigated. I am starting to like The Bitcoin Floor . The Second Clue That Bitcoin Might Not Completely Collapse I’m starting in a weird place, but stick with me. I recently caught the news that Venezuela is collapsing . This stuck out and seemed to summarize the gravity: \n“I think what’s incredible is that we’re witnessing the collapse of a large, modern, wealthy country that has both a democratic and an authoritarian tradition. It’s only a few hours from the United States, and it has the world’s largest supply of crude oil. Venezuela is a powder keg, and the worst-case scenario is now civil war.” Then, I learned about the currency collapse : \n“At the beginning of the year, it took about 3,000 bolivars to buy one U.S. dollar. By Wednesday, it took almost 8,000.” …and… \n“ Prices are set to rise a staggering 720% this year , according to the International Monetary Fund. The collapse of the economy and currency has driven shortages in food, medicine and basic products like toilet paper.” Here’s why this matters. The collapse in Venezuela’s fiat currency has created a Bitcoin mining frenzy : \n“Under these circumstances, a miner starts to look a lot like an ATM. Professors and college students have mined bitcoin; so, rumor has it, have politicians and police officers.” If we add all the pieces together, Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrency) provides almost anyone with an opportunity to create money out of thin air. Although that’s a gross exaggeration, since Bitcoin mining takes electricity, there’s still currently an opportunity to create Bitcoin money with a little bit of effort. Therefore, even if your fiat currency stops working, you can create Bitcoin and use it as a currency. More importantly, this “money out of thin air” from mining activity means that more people will learn about Bitcoin, more people will use Bitcoin, more people will respect Bitcoin as a means of exchange. I still don’t think of Bitcoin as an “investment” in this respect, but it continues to build out The Bitcoin Floor. Every day, it’s less and less likely that Bitcoin will go to zero. There’s evidence that economic insecurity and instability actually increases the potential of Bitcoin. At a minimum, adoption of Bitcoin will continue on the edges and work toward the mainstream. While this might not provide a strong “Buy!” signal, it does provide us with an indication of safety in Bitcoin. Conservative investors should not immediately run away from Bitcoin but instead take time to consider The Bitcoin Floor. While it might not be worthy of investment dollars in your portfolio, greater awareness of what it is and how it works will benefit many investors. As I’ve said to friends: It ain’t going away . Conclusion: Conservative investors who are looking at buying Bitcoin directly, or perhaps via Grayscale Bitcoin Investment Trust ( OTCQX:GBTC ), or the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust ETF ( COIN ) in the future, have The Bitcoin Floor working in their favor. While it’s true that The Bitcoin Floor doesn’t provide investors with a “Buy!” signal, it does provide some assurance about the future of Bitcoin and how catastrophic risk might be lower than a surface level analysis indicates. There are also some lessons about upside potential in light of the fact that Bitcoin is inexorably intertwined with blockchain technology. As such, we can look at current Bitcoin adoption rates in the U.S. and beyond, and then apply S-Curve thinking to investment potential to the upside. In short, it appears that every day, Bitcoin is a bit more “safe” for conservative investors although expectations should be muted with a healthy dose of realism. Bitcoin might relentlessly rise in value over time, but it’s a near certainty that there will be wild fluctuations that will not allow certain conservative investors to sleep well at night, no matter what’s happening in the long run. The Bitcoin Floor is not a place where all conservative investors will want to rest their heads.

      "text": "Browse: Home Bitcoin Buzz Blockchain's 4 Biggest Assumptions Blockchain's 4 Biggest Assumptions Published by on August 26, 2017 | Comments Off on Blockchain's 4 Biggest Assumptions \nWendy Xiao Schadeck is a venture investor at Northzone, based in New York City. She has been following the blockchain space closely, focusing on the behavioral perspective. \nIn this opinion piece, Schadeck outlines her thesis on how the blockchain market is evolving, and where she believes assumptions should be challenged so as to further the tech’s development. \nIn light of the fascination with decentralized blockchains (now termed “crypto”) in recent months, I’ve been spending a lot of time trying to counterbalance the hype with critical perspectives on the technology’s future. \nI am not building a bear case per se, but rather looking for opposing viewpoints in order to practice quantum thinking on the topic, which in my opinion, is absolutely critical to being a successful investor in this space. \nSo far, there are several types of blockchain skeptics I’ve observed. \nThe spectrum ranges from those suffering from incumbent biases to those sitting in the trough of disillusionment to others who have spent real time understanding the recent developments but came out negative because of their experiences or beliefs. There are also fervent disagreements between the different blockchain communities that raise key questions. \nThe issues I’ve been looking for in the midst of all of this are not technical in nature because, in my opinion, those challenges will be solved over time, especially given the massive amount of talent this space has been able to attract and will continue to attract. I have also not focused on external factors such as regulatory risk , though they are huge concerns. I believe that signals shown so far suggest regulators are very savvy and are careful to enact new regulation. \nIf you’ve been following the space for some time, you’ve probably observed that opinions about decentralized blockchain are pretty binary. The reason for this is that the biggest risks faced by projects in this space are existential. There isn’t a full continuum of outcomes that are easily understood or widely acknowledged. \nEither you’re a believer or you aren’t, and a lot of it hinges on your views on the issues below. I have also searched for answers to these questions, but so far I have found no clear answers except for further experimentation and a natural evolution of the ecosystem. \nTherefore, it makes sense to think of these as basic assumptions that the entire space has been built upon: 1. Mass user adoption \nThe first line of defense for many critics is the argument that blockchain technologies can only replicate use cases that centralized systems already achieve, and that because of this, there is no reason for the average user to switch. \nWhile I believe that during this first phase of adoption we will see these skeuomorphic use cases, I also think we haven’t begun to understand yet what blockchain technologies can enable. The most powerful use cases for the internet didn’t evolve until many years after initial adoption. However, we still have to prove adoption in the skeuomorphic period, and I think my hypothesis around adoption by investment addresses that. \nThe gist of it is that instead of fishing for a future application solving a future consumer pain point, we should observe how bitcoin, ethereum and the hundreds of other tokens on the market today have been achieved adoption through a similar pattern: \nInitial investment due to speculation or alignment of beliefs-> Emotional commitment to the growth of the network -> Adoption -> Advocacy (and further investment on technologies built on top). \nThe value prop to adopters of new technology used to be limited to only having their user pain points addressed in a better way (and whatever coolness factor comes with telling their friends about it first), which is why, as VCs, we are so used to only looking for user value proposition in the traditional sense, driven by slick onboarding funnels, library completeness, etc. \nThe bar is much higher compared to existing solutions, thus it is true that most blockchain use cases don’t deliver a differentiated value prop on those dimensions. \nHowever, in the decentralized world, adopters of new blockchain technologies can actually make money while the network is growing by earning or investing in tokens. This psychology is unexplored territory and taps into highly motivating human forces such as greed. \nHowever, if this hypothesis makes any sense, then we have to also assume that early adopters will not turn off later adopters (network gets too expensive/volatile to use from speculation), and that investors will ultimately become users, which brings us to our next big blockchain assumption: 2. Tokens should be entangled \nTokens have two roles  – serving as both a  ticket to a network’s services and a vehicle for investing in a network. This means token prices are much more volatile, and that lowers its utility as a transfer of value because the price of the exchanged good or service can fluctuate quickly in a short time-span. \nThis effect is described well in this article authored by Marcin Rudolf : \n“Consider the following: Do you invest in a car factory by buying a lot of cars for a price much above market value? If this idea sounds weird to you check again what are you buying when you invest in app tokens. You get a right to use a network  –  it’s like [getting] vouchers for cars instead of shares in a car production business. Do you really need those years of access to global super computer? Do you really need to make millions of transactions over the ethereum network? Probably not so you will realize your investment by dumping your tokens on secondary market. In that case, however, you should ask yourself what happens to your car factory if you first massively drive up product price by hoarding cars it produces and then dump them on secondary market?” \nThis creates conflicts of interest between token investors, who want the prices to go up, and spenders who want the prices to remain stable. \nAssuming investors are spenders as to my earlier point, token entanglement then disincentives participants to use their tokens in exchange for the goods and services provided by the network, which makes the network useless and also the token. \nIn the earlier days of bitcoin, people spent bitcoin because no one believed bitcoin was real. Now, stories of the “ $5 million pizza ” make token investors incredibly weary of spending their tokens. \nIf we model out when investors become spenders, it is when value of services that can be bought with a token becomes more than the expected future value of the token you’re holding. This will happen when token price stabilizes, and supply equals demand. \nHowever, by that point, will there be enough development done on the network for the token to have significant utility value? If yes, then prices for using the network services will be compared to prices for doing things the centralized way. \nIf not, we will probably have a trough of disillusionment period during which many people sell their tokens and the true “hodlers” form the bottom. Which projects survive this period depend on both the speed of development and how many true “hodlers” exist in the network. \nWhile most projects are not at a stage where the network can even deliver any meaningful utility value, several recent consumer-facing projects (Brave, Kik, etc.) will encounter this problem before others. \nIf they’re able to build incentives into the product and make people spend (maybe in order to earn?), then that will be an important proof point. Also, if the end user is a machine rather than a human (in the case of pure infrastructure tokens), then the problem is less evident. \nThere are also a number of projects working on “stablecoins,” which from my limited understanding are kind of like collateralized FX swaps, but the usefulness of these will be limited in times of extreme volatility because they require huge amounts of capital to work. 3. ICOs incentivize good projects \nI’ve been very pessimistic about ICOs as a funding mechanism (at least in its current form) because incentives for the founding team are so misaligned with the project’s investors and community, and even the most prudent founding teams will have trouble allocating hundreds of millions of dollars efficiently at a pre-product stage. \nHistory has not shown that large amounts of funding at very early stages of a project leads to successful outcomes. A more ideal distribution mechanism might be more of a helicopter drop and liquidity via decentralized exchanges or a phased, proof-point based model of token sale. \nAlbert Wenger wrote a good blog post on this recently where he urges projects to set up internal mechanisms for post-ICO governance. Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin also wrote a blog post earlier this summer illustrating issues with single round ICOs. \nRight now, it certainly feels like a race to build the largest arsenal via ICOs before clear regulatory guidance, and it is the most rational thing to do given the short term incentives, but arguably, similar to dot-com days, it might not bode positively for these projects’ ability to build value for its community long run without stronger governance mechanisms. \nThis is also a symptom of current market conditions and should naturally self-correct when the hype dies down and investors become more critical. I am optimistic that when capital becomes scarce again, it just takes one responsible project to establish the norm, and the rest will have to follow suit because the market should negatively select against any project that doesn’t. 4. Governance paradox \nThis is often the most commonly cited core issue for decentralized blockchain networks. How do blockchain networks define the rules? If they can trust a central party to define the rules, then there is no need for a blockchain in the first place. \nOxford professor Vili Lehdonvirta authored a piece on this in 2016 which explains the concept really well: \n“Blockchain technologies cannot escape the problem of governance. Whether they recognize it or not, they face the same governance issues as conventional third-party enforcers. You can use technologies to potentially enhance the processes of governance (eg. transparency, online deliberation, e-voting), but you can’t engineer away governance as such. All this leads me to wonder how revolutionary blockchain technologies really are. If you still rely on a Board of Directors or similar body to make it work, how much has economic organization really changed? And this leads me to my final point, a provocation: once you address the problem of governance, you no longer need blockchain; you can just as well use conventional technology that assumes a trusted central party to enforce the rules, because you’re already trusting somebody (or some organization/process) to make the rules.” \nThe bitcoins scaling debate is the most well-known manifestation of this issue, and some have looked to forks as a way to define governance by means of natural selection of blockchain networks. \nHowever, Vili argues that competition via forking does not solve the problem because strong network effects prevent competition. Building accountability into the nodes might be another solution (for example, like R3), which might limit the use case to centralized protocols or a decentralized protocol managed by a central party. These types of blockchain networks are less economically transformative. \nUltimately, more sophisticated governance mechanisms should evolve, built by others way smarter on this topic than I am. There are giant pools of knowledge in sociology, behavioral economics, etc. that are still largely untapped by those building cryptoeconomic designs, and this is where I am spending my time these days — making these connections. I am a believer that this will not be done through technology alone; our governance processes will have to evolve significantly in order for the technology to work. I would even go as far to say that blockchain technologies allow societies to rapidly prototype human coordination processes that have historically taken centuries to develop. \nMany thanks to those who helped contribute ideas to this article either directly or via conversations (in person and on Twitter): @jessewldn, @iiterature, @petkanics, @bradusv, @jmonegro, @pjparson, @julianmoncadaNY, @arbedout, @pete_rizzo_, @pt, @aweissman, @kevinsullivan36, @arthurB, and many others… \nWendy posts regularly about blockchain on her Twitter and on Medium . \nDanger image via Shutterstock The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk strives to offer an open platform for dialogue and discussion on all things blockchain by encouraging contributed articles.

      "text": "Homogeneous (Each denomination is uniform in value) Easy to Transport Easy to Store \nIn the distant past Gold and Silver were the universally accepted Good Money. And I even wrote how the world accepted Gold as Good Money here: https://steemit.com/money/@daniel3/the-story-of-how-pieces-of-paper-became-money Bitcoin and the Cryptocurrency Revolution \nEver since the release of Bitcoin into the world from Jan 4, 2009 people kept criticizing it and saying how it would fail. But after over 8 years and a price of over $4000 people are still scratching their heads wondering how it hasn't crashed yet -- and even more shocking to them is the fact that over more than 800 more Cryptocurrencies have emerged successfully by themselves! \nAnalysts and Doom-prophets keep repeating that Bitcoin and the other Cryptocurrencies are bubbles soon to burst based on what they know of traditional finance and stocks. \nBut what they fail to see, or more likely have chosen NOT to see, is Gresham's Law at work: \nBad Money drives out Good Money if they exchange for the same price Good Money are the cryptocurrencies that complete our checklist. Bad Money (based on our checklist) are the FIAT CURRENCIES around the world: US Dollars, Euros, Sterlings, Pesos... etc. The price rise of Bitcoin is not behaving like typical stocks. People around the world are simply rejecting the coins and banknotes force-fed on them by the central banks of the world and are REPLACING them with GOOD MONEY cryptocurrencies. \nWhat was once laughed and ridiculed by the rich banking elite are now being eyed with fear and concern because they can see a real possibility of a monetary revolution that would render all their wealth worthless to the world. \nThe conversion from BAD MONEY to GOOD MONEY is not perfect with other cryptocurrencies turning out to be scams or just failing to complete the checklist of being GOOD MONEY. But with a market capitalization of over $150 Billion the cryptocurrencies are now too big to ignore anymore. The financial markets around the world are TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS today. What do you think would happen to the cryptocurrency prices if investors from those financial markets added to the Market Capitalization and raised it to at least $1 TRILLION DOLLARS? The original Bitcoin and the Segwit pivot \nWhat drove the adoption and price of Bitcoin up from nothing was purely basic laws of economics lining up. Before Segwit Bitcoin was accelerating to mainstream adoption as GOOD MONEY as evident in its skyrocketing price and number of transactions. \nBut that was until the 1 MB ceiling was hit and everything changed. Transactions are getting slower and getting more expensive. \nTo address this after years of debate and politics miners and users were forced to accept Segwit and after activation the effect was effectively zero. Transactions remained expensive and the number of unconfirmed transactions keep getting bigger. Until something changes Bitcoin today is no longer GOOD MONEY Bitcoin Cash and the Alt-coins \nGresham's Law will soon reveal itself once more but this time against Bitcoin as it currently stands \nBad Money drives out Good Money if they are forced by law But Good Money drives out Bad Money if there is no force by law When there is no coercion by law Good Money will always circulate and the people will reject the Bad Money. \nSegwit failed to deliver it's promises and we are left with a stunted Bitcoin network. \nAnd right now, because Bitcoin is no longer Easy to Transport/Transact people will sooner or later reject it and find other cryptocurrencies. It is basic economics and Gresham's Law will prevail. \nBitcoin Cash would be the next logical choice for current Bitcoin users since the only difference is that it has expanded it's Blocksize limit to 8MB allowing for more transactions and cheaper fees to be processed. And if they had Bitcoins before the Hard Fork then they would have an equivalent amount of Bitcoin Cash to use and transact with. \nThe Market Capitalization of Bitcoin would slowly transfer to Bitcoin Cash and effectively continue the original intent of Bitcoin of being a peer-to-peer digital cash being used with cheaper fees and faster transactions and available for everyone around the world to use. \nAnd the same can be said with Alt-coins as well of being able to offer faster transactions and cheaper fees than Bitcoin today. As long as they follow the checklist of being Good Money then in the long-term future they could might as well replace Bitcoin in dominance. Mass speculation and media hype are keeping the Bitcoin price up but when Gresham's law finally catches up we could be seeing a very TRUE FLIPPENING if no improvements happen soon...

      "text": "Glossen & Kommentare (nmz) - Zugegeben: In letzter Zeit habe ich mich hier viel zu subjektiv mit thematischen Petitessen beschäftigt. Mit den 68ern, dem öffentlich-rechtlichen Rundfunk, der Bundeskanzlerin. Das lag auch an meiner etwas schlagseitigen Informantenstruktur. Das hat sich gerade geändert. Aus bestens ausgewiesenen Quellen erreicht mich Grauenhaftes. Um juristischen Problemen aus dem Weg zu gehen, eröffne ich hiermit das Unternasen-Schmalschnauzer-Blog – schon um im sicheren Fake-News-Windschatten des renommierten Breitbart-Networks geschützt dahinzugleiten. [Vorab aus: Politik & Kultur 2017/05] 26.08.2017 - Von Theo Geißler Sie haben es sicher gelesen: Donald Trump hat bei Beobachtung der amerikanischen Jahrhundert-Sonnenfinsternis keine Schwarzbrille aufgesetzt und seine Augen ungeschützt den Brutalstrahlen während der Verdunklung unseres Zentralgestirnes preisgegeben. Nur vordergründig stellt sich die Frage, ob er neben den bekannten mentalen Verbruzzelungen nun auch noch okulare davongetragen hat. Wer allerdings hofft, durch eine Art solarer Linsenkorrektur wären einschlägige Fehlsichtigkeiten behoben, wird wohl enttäuscht werden. Zwar hat Trump in seiner Amtszeit – was seine Haltung betrifft – schon mehr Pirouetten gedreht als ehemals Hans-Jürgen Bäumler samt Marika Kilius. Aber es war schon auffällig, dass er so kurz nach der Konfrontation mit einem angeblichen Naturereignis zum Beispiel seine knallharten Afghanistan- ankündigungen quasi konterkarierte. „Naturereignis?“– Breitbart hilft! Längst ist bekannt, dass derzeit nur Russland in der Lage ist, nennenswerte Frachtmengen in den Weltraum zu befördern. Seit einigen Jahren verlassen regelmäßig Sojus-Raketen das Kosmodrom Baikonur samt geheimem Instrumentarium. Bestückt mit geostationären Satelliten, die zwecks punktgenauer Funkübertragung riesige Parabolspiegel entfalten. Mit ihnen können – zwar noch nicht perfekt aber eindrucks- und wirkungsvoll – genug Gehirnströme auf Mutter Erde manipuliert werden. In einem ersten noch breitflächig angelegten Feldversuch hat Putin so die US -Präsidentschaftswahlen „mitgestaltet“– ohne sich letztlich über die Synapsen-Gewitter in Trumps vorderen Hirnlappen klar zu sein. Noch ist nicht alles genau berechenbar. Bleibt als letztes Mittel der Kontrolle die Top-Secret-Info, dass es sich bei der Präsidentengattin und First Lady Melania um ein humanoides chinesisches Robotermodell jüngster Generation des Typs Wan-Tan handelt, über dessen optimalen Einsatz zwischen Moskau und Peking noch verhandelt wird. Während CIA und FBI in den Yankee-Windows- XP -Computern und Wahlautomaten landauf landab immer noch nach Spuren russischer Hackerangriffe suchen, lässt Putin bestimmte europäische Politiker nach Gusto individuell bestrahlen. So hat er Erdoğan, Orbán und Kaczyński mit einer Mischung aus Größenwahn und Nationalismus so gut es ging „gehirngeimpft“. Bei Österreichs Kanzlerhoffnung Sebastian Kurz und unserer Angela Merkel scheiterte er bislang aufgrund einer asbestähnlichen Haarspray-Mixtur der Delinquenten. Auch der Versuch, IS -Terroristen und generell Islamisten zu gesundem Kapitalismus zu bekehren, schlug fehl, weil Fanatismus und radikale „Religiosität“ entscheidende Hirnsektionen unzugänglich machen. Dass Putin mittlerweile selbst einigermaßen ferngesteuert wird, hat er freilich noch nicht bemerkt. Einem „Konsortium“ aus Chaos-Computer-Club, Greenpeace, Johannitern und Vier Pfoten gelang es, sich in die Datenströme der russischen Satelliten einzuhacken. Seither bauen sie sogenannte Byte-Bremsen in die Manipulationssoftware, die bestimmte geplante Alleinherrschaftsexzesse zumindest verlangsamen. Dank abzustatten ist in diesem Zusammenhang Altbundeskanzler Gerhard Schröder. Er hat sich als Doppelagent in den innersten Vertrauenskreis Wladimir Putins emporgearbeitet und den Quellcode der eingesetzten Programme im Darknet für ein paar Millio­nen Bitcoins an ihm unbekannte neue Besitzer – eben das „Konsortium“ vertickt – dass er sich damit einen Packen digitales Falschgeld eingehandelt hat, wird er schon noch rausfinden. Mittlerweile testete das „Konsortium“ in einer Nebenhalle der gerade beendeten Kölner gamescom kommerzielle und politische Verwertungsmöglichkeiten ihrer günstig erworbenen neuen Facilitys. Gerade für den Multiplayer-Modus im Web eröffneten sich ungeahnte Möglichkeiten. Es erwies sich als glücklicher Zufall, dass gleichzeitig die USA und Südkorea ein weitgehend digital konfiguriertes Manöver abhielten. Problemlos übernahm das „Konsortium“ die Steuerung und sorgte für ein derartiges militärisches Chaos, das Donald Trump zunächst von einem Atomschlag gegen die schurkischen Nordkoreaner Abstand nehmen ließ. Dank des exorbitanten Reality-Faktors geriet die Umsetzung dieses Zugriffs in die Spielewelt von „World of Warcraft“ für das produzierende US -Unternehmen Blizzard-Entertainment zu einem derart sensationellen Verkaufserfolg, dass eine sechsstellige Spende an „Vier-Pfoten“ keinerlei kommerziellen Schmerz verursachte. Alles in allem – muss ich gestehen – verstand ich jetzt auch, weshalb der Deutsche Kulturrat die Veredelung von Egoshootern und Computer-Kriegsspielen in Kunstwerke – nur noch mit sieben Prozent Mehrwertsteuer zu belegen – engagiert vertritt. Ich empfehle genaues Studium des vorliegenden Heftes. \nTheo Geißler ist Herausgeber von Politik & Kultur Weiterführende Informationen:",

      "text": "Joshua Althauser Bitfinex Addresses Concerns About its Customer Support Issues Cryptocurrency exchange platform Bitfinex asks their users for understanding regarding the customer support issues that they are currently encountering. 1795 Total views 98 Total shares Brief Cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex is asking its users to be patient with them. In a statement posted on their blog , Bitfinex apologized for the long wait times for responses from customer service. They cited the huge boom in cryptocurrency as the reason for the delays. \nPart of their statement reads: \n“The past six months have been unlike anything we have ever experienced as cryptocurrencies have reached an unprecedented level of coverage. It took five years to handle three billion orders on Bitfinex – in the last four months alone, we have handled more than one billion orders”. \nBitfinex is a cryptocurrency exchange trading and currency-storage platform based out of Hong Kong, owned and operated by iFinex Inc. Since 2014, it has been the largest Bitcoin exchange in the world, with over 10 percent market share. Customers thinking of pressing legal actions \nDue to the support issues, many of its customers were thinking of filing legal actions against Bitfinex. \nIn a Reddit post , bitglue called for legal action, saying: \n“I have been waiting for days. They said the withdrawal for XRP is complete but when i[sic] check it in the block it’s not even existent. They are pulling all our legs. I have their address in Hong Kong, and Local Cyber Crime Police Taskforce in Hong Kong. Let’s submit an official complaint. We cannot let this just slide. every exchange is starting to toy with us not knowing that they are where they are because of us.” \nMost commenters agreed with Redditor bitglue, saying their coins have been stuck for 18-20 days now without any response from Bitfinex. \nReclusiarh said: “I am with you, a week my 15 ETH has been stuck in limbo because I didn't know bitstamp uses smart contracts, and when I scan the wallet address the ETH is right there so this is some bullshit from Bitfinex, let's do something”. \nA Bitfinex user who prefer to remain anonymous said the following in an email to Cointelegraph (and included screenshots): \n“Recently a lot of Bitfinex users' funds have been vanishing during withdrawal and deposits, including mine. Some people have opened more than a couple tickets and waited over 2-3 weeks and no response. In my case, I have sent 18 ethers to MEW and although the status says \"complete\" on the Bitfinex platform, no TX have been broadcasted. So now there's nothing on my Bitfinex account nor MEW. My ethers have pretty much vanished into thin air. And no, the tickets haven't been answered.” \nLater on that day, the same user informed Cointelegraph that: \n\"Some development: I got a response from Claudia of customer support. I think it's the result of doing everything I can to get my ticket noticed: posting on reddit, facebook, youtube etc. although how long it would take to resolve is yet to be seen.\" Bitfinex solution \nTo address the situation, Bitfinex said it has already increased its support staff five times in the past two months. \nAt this point, they are asking for more understanding from customers because of the time it takes to train new staff. \nThey assured the public that they are doing their best to scale their support system so that they can attend to customers’ concerns in a timely manner. \n“We are constantly working on improving and scaling our support system to deal with all our customers’ questions and concerns in a timely fashion. We hope that you will bear with us in these turbulent times, and we promise you we are working tirelessly to resolve your support tickets and to scale our support staff to be able to provide quicker responses.” \nBitfinex has also recently started charging $25 every time a user erroneously sends funds to the wrong wallet, such as BTC to BCH. \nThe company has been under immense pressure due to such customer support issues. Other exchanges such as Poloniex have also been under rigorous pressure to ensure greater customer service amidst insolvency rumors . Follow Cointelegraph on Facebook",

      "text": "By helping us think about the cost of masculinity, Masculinity Coin highlights the fact that it is one of the greatest costs in existence, yet it appears on few—if any—budgets. August 26, 2017 \nEmbed from Getty Images Cryptocurrencies \nOnly those living under a rock will have missed the increasing number of stories in the media referring to cryptocurrencies. Once the preserve of geeks and those purchasing dubious items from the dark web, cryptocurrencies are now garnering mainstream attention thanks to the incredible rising price of Bitcoin, which has in turn pulled up the price of other cryptocurrencies. \nSo there is no better time for those with an interest in masculinity to introduce Masculinity Coin , the cryptocurrency for men (to avoid any confusion, while genuine, Masculinity Coin is totally my own invention). For those with a more technical bent, Masculinity Coin is an ERC20 token digital asset built upon the Ethereum blockchain, the contract for which can be viewed on Etherscan . But why should you care? I’m glad you asked! Part cryptocurrency, part art project, Masculinity Coin gets us thinking along three crucial lines: the nature of masculinity and technology, how we might “cost” the impact of masculinity, and the illusionary nature of masculinity. Masculinity, Technology and Work \nModern technology is typically perceived as a masculine domain, despite the fact that women played a significant role in its development . In the past couple of months alone we have seen numerous articles about “toxic masculinity” in the workplace at Silicon Valley companies , culminating in the much-famed firing of a Google employee who expressed views that were inconsistent with the company’s diversity policy. As a product of this technological domain, Masculinity Coin holds up a mirror to its masculine culture and as such functions as a form of critique. \nBut while workplaces in Silicon Valley may be examples of everyday sexism, more generally the workplace is a double-edged sword for men. Masculinity Coin also alludes to the expectation that masculinity “provides coin” through work. Stress from the workplace is particularly hard for men , and lack of financial success results in a greater likelihood of men being single : even women are now feeling the pressure of this as they cannot find men of supposedly “equal” success with which to start a family. So while men enjoy certain benefits from the systemic nature of male privilege, they also experience significant pressures at the individual level. The Cost of Masculinity \nMasculinity Coin suggests thinking about masculinity in dollar terms: in other words, the “cost” of masculinity. Those with an interest in men’s rights advocacy will point to the costs involved in men’s poor representation in various domains such as physical and mental health, education, homelessness, violence, and incarceration. Those with an interest in feminism will point to the costs involved in preventing women’s full participation in the economy (a McKinsey report puts a figure of $12 trillion of potential future growth on this). \nIf we were to extend the cost of masculinity to include traditionally masculine ways of asserting domination such as war and a rapacious attitude towards the environment, that total cost could run into tens of trillions of dollars. This cost is perhaps broadly equal to the total value of “real” moneyculinity in the world (but nowhere near the amount of “money” represented by debt and derivatives ). \nBy helping us think about the cost of masculinity, Masculinity Coin highlights the fact that it is one of the greatest costs in existence, yet it appears on few—if any—budgets. There does not even appear to have ever been a single comprehensive quantitative study undertaken of the cost of masculinity, despite decades of gender studies. Masculinity as Illusion \nThe Five Stages of Masculinity is a map of the different ways people perceive masculinity. Stage 5 proposes that masculinity does not actually exist, or rather that “masculinity exists as a consensual hallucination which nevertheless has many real effects.” Cryptocurrencies provide an interesting parallel to Stage 5 masculinity, inasmuch as they do not really exist other than via an agreement between parties: they are a consensual hallucination. The real-world effects of such hallucinations can be swift and profound: Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) are currently raising billions of dollars of “real” money for business start-ups and now outstrip funds raised through early stage venture capital. As we saw above, the real-world effects of masculinity-as-hallucination can come at an even higher cost. \nThe idea that masculinity is an illusion means that ultimately it can mean anything to anyone: masculinity is a shape-shifter (this reveals another crypto-synchronicity, ShapeShift is a well-known exchange for converting one cryptocurrency to another). As such, Masculinity Coin can also mean anything to anyone. As this article suggests, holding and trading Masculinity Coin could be seen as a way of critiquing traditional masculinity. At the same time, it could be seen as a celebration of traditional masculinity. No individual has the ability to claim that one interpretation is “true” while another is “false.” Ultimately, Masculinity Coin can be considered as a useful thinking exercise, a giant act of trolling, or even a scam: all three of which can—and should—be applied to masculinity itself.__ ",

      "text": "by cryptohoney \nSerious question about LN and bitcoin. Correct me if I’m wrong but is this true? I can't simply open up one channel on the LN and deposit money, and then anybody else connect to the same LN can transact with me. \nExample: Lets fast forward into the future where Walmart, Exxon, burger king, home depot are all using the LN. I would have to open a channel to each one of them, deposit money into each one of them and at this point I can transact with them? It’s not like there is a central place on the LN where all these companies are connected to and therefore I only deposit bitcoin once into a channel and then I can transact with any of those companies at will? \nExample #2: I have already deposited money into a LN payment channel. I come across a store that also uses the LN. At this point I cannot transact with them because I first have to open a payment channel with them, deposit bitcoin into this channel, get confirmed, then I can transact? Is that correct? If it is, that s u c k s and is disappointing. I still love bitcoin though. Thanks in advance. ",

      "text": "August 25, 2017 / 6:56 AM / 3 hours ago Factbox: U.S. arrests of Russian cyber criminals hit record high Reuters Staff 4 Min Read MOSCOW (Reuters) - U.S. action against suspected Russian cyber criminals has surged to a record high this year despite efforts by President Donald Trump to improve ties with Moscow. The United States has arrested or indicted seven Russians on U.S. cyber crime charges in 2017. On average, just two Russian cyber criminals were extradited to the United States each year between 2010 and the start of this year. Below is a breakdown of the arrests and indictments so far this year: STANISLAV LISOV Arrested in Spain on Jan. 13, aged 32. Lisov, also known by hacker names \"Black\" and \"Blackf\", according to court documents, is accused of creating the \"NeverQuest\" banking trojan which targeted customers of financial institutions around the world and caused millions of dollars of damage. A Spanish court agreed to extradite Lisov to the United States in early August, where he faces up to 35 years in prison. Lisov's lawyer opposed the extradition, arguing that the allegations and evidence against him were too vague, that the United States did not have jurisdiction over any of the alleged crimes. IGOR SUSHCHIN Indicted on March 15, aged 43. One of two officers from Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) charged by the United States in March with masterminding the 2014 theft of up to 500 million Yahoo accounts, the first time the U.S. government criminally charged Russian spies for cyber offences. Reuters was unable to reach Sushchin for comment. DMITRY DOKUCHAYEV Indicted on March 15, aged 33. The second FSB officer indicted in the Yahoo hack and Sushchin's subordinate. Allegedly a former hacker who stole and sold credit card details under the online alias \"Forb\", Dokuchayev was one of four men detained on mysterious treason charges by Russian authorities in late 2016. He is currently being held in Moscow. Reuters was unable to reach Dokuchayev for comment. ALEXEI BELAN Indicted on March 15, aged 29. One of two hackers accused of working with Sushchin and Dokuchayev to break into Yahoo email servers and steal data from up to 500 million user accounts. Belan has spent years on the FBI's most-wanted list for crimes. He was arrested in Europe in June 2013 but escaped to Russia before he could be extradited to the United States. Reuters was unable to reach Belan for comment. PETER LEVASHOV Arrested in Spain on April 7, aged 36. A spammer accused by U.S. prosecutors of operating a botnet, or network, of tens of thousands of infected computers used by cyber criminals to pump out spam emails. Levashov has been accused of using the botnet for a multitude of criminal schemes, such as stock fraud, online credential phishing attempts and the distribution of malware, including ransomware. He is being held in Spain awaiting extradition to the United States, where he faces up to 52 years in jail. He denies the charges against him. YURY MARTYSHEV Arrested in Latvia on April 26, aged 35 Accused of helping run a service that let cyber criminals test-drive malware before attacking victims. His extradition to the United States was denounced by the Russian government as \"another case of kidnapping of a Russian citizen by the US authorities.\" Martyshev denies the charges against him, according to Russian media reports. ALEXANDER VINNIK Arrested in Greece on July 25, aged 37 Vinnik is accused of laundering at least $4 billion in criminal funds through the BTC-e crytpo-currency exchange since 2011. This is alleged to be part of a scheme to facilitate crimes including computer hacking, fraud and drug trafficking. U.S. authorities also linked him to the failure of Mt. Gox, a Japan-based bitcoin exchange that collapsed in 2014 after being hacked. He is being held in Greece awaiting extradition to the United States, where he faces up to 55 years in jail. He denies the charges against him, according to Greek media reports. ",

      "text": "How Blockchain Helps Content Creators Build Ecosystems and Generate Profits Three Blockchain startups are leading the Blockchain-based online publishing and advertising market: report 2247 Total views 143 Total shares Blockchain The online publishing and advertising market is heavily reliant and dependent on mediators, third party service providers and centralized systems. As a result, like the music industry, revenue distribution has become incredibly complex and opaque, leading to a less efficient and transparent ecosystem for online content creators. \nIn a recent report, The Next Web named three Blockchain startups Brave , Matchpool and WildSpark that are leading the Blockchain-based online publishing and advertising market. The three startups are targeting three different sectors within the online advertising market in order to create a more fair system for online content creators. Brave Brave is a browser developed by the co-founder of the Mozilla project. Content creators such as media outlets and film producers are able to monetize their websites without partnering with mediators or third party servicers such as Google or Amazon ad services. Instead, Brave integrates local advertisements on the websites and based on traffic, it sends out Basic Attention Tokens (BATs) which can be exchanged through cryptocurrency exchange platforms to Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies or fiat currencies. \nBecause Brave collaborates directly with advertisers, content providers will no longer be forced to take 50 to 70 percent revenue cuts which are often submitted to third party service providers as commission. Matchpool Matchpool also creates a unique infrastructure with which content creators can develop and monetize their content through premium memberships. For instance, on Matchpool, content creators are permitted to create pools or groups of users and impose premium membership fees. Matchpool can be best described as being similar to premium content distribution platforms such as YouTube Red, with a slight twist: content providers can freely select their monetization methods. \n“I noticed that all the people in the world have a universal truth. Something that we all value and incorporate into our life. And, it doesn’t matter if we are Japanese, Chinese, American, etc...Trust is hard to gain. It’s earned. Matchpool’s currency is also trust and that trust is the cryptocurrency,” Matchpool founder Yonatan Ben Shimon. WildSpark Lastly, WildSpark , which operates similarly to Patreon, allows users to finance their content creators on any platforms such as YouTube with cryptocurrencies. Users on WildSpark can choose to donate to their favorite content creators without being limited to certain platforms and financial methods. \nIn all, the three abovementioned startups Brave, Matchpool and WildSpark provide alternative advertising and monetizing methods for content providers. Brave is an alternative to major ad service providers such as Google or Amazon, Matchpool is an alternative to premium content providers like YouTube Red or Twitch premium and WildSpark is an alternative platform to Patreon, which is vastly used by content providers on YouTube and Wordpress. \nMany startups and projects are attempting to utilize the Bitcoin network and Ethereum’s smart contract protocol to create a more transparent, fair and efficient ecosystem for content providers.

      "text": "Blockchain Tech As A Hedge Against Low Oil Prices By Editorial Dept - Aug 26, 2017, 11:59 PM CDT \nThe “ paradox of plenty ,” natural resources are both a gift and a curse to emerging economies. Rather than providing a flourishing economy, often the result of discovering an abundance of new resources is quite the opposite. \nThe story is repeated over and over again throughout the world. Countries rich in natural resources have fallen victim to poverty, unrest, and tyranny. \nIn the 1997 study of Jeffrey D. Sachs and Andrew M. Warner, the writers suggest that rather than bolstering economic growth, countries with substantial resources often experience slower economic growth with little to no evidence to suggest geographical location or climate has any impact on this phenomenon. \nThere seems to be a direct relationship between reliance upon energy resources and authoritarianism. Larry Diamond of Stanford University said : \"There are twenty-three countries in the world that derive at least 60 percent of their exports from oil and gas and not a single one is a real democracy.” \nVenezuela may be the most striking example of this occurrence right now. The country has the largest oil reserves on the planet, but is now experiencing one of the worst economic crisis in its history. Once the richest economy in South America, the country at present resembles one in the midst of a civil war. In 2014, the country saw its murder rate skyrocket. \nVenezuela’s overdependence on oil has led the country into a difficult position. Oil accounts for 96 percent of the country’s exports, leaving the country especially vulnerable to changes in the price of oil. Not only that, the country’s reliance on the resource has created a toxic relationship between the oil industry and the government, with corruption rampant and leaders unwilling to part with their cash cow. \nOn the other side of the world, Iraq has suffered a similar dilemma. \nOver half of Iraq’s GDP comes from oil, in fact, the country’s reserves represent 10 percent of the entire world’s total proven oil reserves. \nIn Saddam Hussein’s Iraq, the country suffered similar effects to Venezuela. Hussein’s regime used revenue generated from the country’s abundant resources to oppress citizens, boost the military, and funded fruitless wars with neighboring Iran and Kuwait. Additionally, the regime built large palaces and siphoned cash into their personal bank accounts. \nThese actions derailed the country’s economic promise and led to one of the deadliest wars in recent times. \nIn Africa, Nigeria was once set to breach the world’s top 20 economies. The country was experiencing a promising surge in growth. Beginning in 1956 , when oil was first discovered in the Niger Delta, the country began down the dangerous path of oil reliance. \nRelated: Tesla Successfully Raises Funds As Cash Bleed Continues \nNigeria was hit especially hard the fluctuation of oil prices which took projects offline and crushed the nation’s GDP. Now, the country faces a negative growth rate and unrest. It must look toward other industries if it hopes to return to its former glory. Former Governor, Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Prof. Charles Soludo noted : “For too long, we have lived with borrowed robes, and I think for the next generation, for the 400 million Nigerians expected in this country by the year 2050, oil cannot be the way forward for the future.” \nIt is true, diversification of a country’s economy is essential to combat this curse. \nThere are several countries which have identified their own overreliance on non-renewable natural resource and have begun to diversify their economies through new technological developments. \nSaudi Arabia, Russia, and the United Arab Emirates are notable examples. Each has embarked on a path involving technology to ease their dependence on oil and gas. \nSaudi Arabia’s Crown Price Mohammad bin Salman has developed the Vision 2030 plan. The plan seeks to accomplish a broad set of goals, but primarily to free Saudi Arabia from its reliance on oil. Through the development of renewable resources and consumer goods, the country aims to increase its non-oil exports as a share of GDP to 50 percent. \nSaudi Arabia also aims to revamp their banking system through the use of blockchain technology to streamline its real estate sector within the country and ease trade-based transactions with its neighbors. \nThe United Arab Emirates is also looking to diversify. The country has recently invested $163-billion in renewable energy projects. Additionally, the UAE has unveiled its Energy Strategy 2050 . Sheikh Mohammed, Vice President of UAE and the ruler of the emirate of Dubai explained : \"The plan aims to increase usage efficiency by 40 percent and increase clean-energy contributions to 50 percent.” \nThe UAE is also at the forefront of a move to streamline its government and banking sector by using blockchain technology with the goal to shift to a diversified and “knowledge-based” economy. \nIn UAE’s Vision 2021 , the country looks to blockchain technology to completely revamp the way the government tracks and processes data. Through the process of eliminating unnecessary complications in its bureaucratic process, the country aims to streamline its education system, healthcare, and banking sectors. \nRussia may be one of the most interesting examples of diversification away from natural resources. Instead of completely abandoning its reliance on oil, the country is embarking on a path to create its own $100-billion Bitcoin mine . \nRelated: Goldman Sachs Warns Of Global Oil Demand Peak \nThe Russian government has developed a plan to create an initial coin offering (ICO) to fund a large-scale Bitcoin mining operation in which miners will use the country’s 20GW excess power capacity to mine Bitcoin in order to compete with China. “RMC plans to use semiconductor chips designed in Russia for use in satellites to minimize power consumption in computers for crypto-mining,” Putin’s internet ombudsman, Dmitry Marinichev, said at a news conference in Moscow. Marinichev added that the country has the potential to reach up to a 30 percent share in the global cryptocurrency market. \nIn this ambitious effort, the mining hardware is given to individuals, each of whom receive a share of the Bitcoin mined, providing not only incentive to participate, but a drastic economic shift, the outcome of which is yet to be seen. \nWhile there may not be one simple solution in shifting away from natural resources, following these nations in their individual paths may provide solid examples moving forward. Through technology, there is now more opportunity than ever to diversify away for non-renewable natural resources. \nBy Michael Kern",

      "text": "Posted on 9:39 pm August 26, 2017 Author Guest Author Categories Press Release Tags cointal , P2P marketplace Cointal announces P2P multi-cryptocurrency marketplace that reassures all traders at once. Users can now signup in advance. \nCointal is the one website you’ve been waiting for. So far, we may have seen many Peer-to-Peer Marketplaces, but none concerned themselves with procuring any feature that would reassure all traders at once. \nFirst of all, no P2P marketplace has ever proposed more than two cryptocurrencies at once. On Cointal, you can choose the deal that suits you the most and buy/sell the most promising cryptocurrencies so as to exchange it for cash later on. \nFor the moment, Bitcoin (BTC), Ripple (XRP), Ethereum (ETH) and Litecoin (LTC) are already available for traders on the platform. Cointal is aiming to become the first centralized Multi-cryptocurrency P2P Marketplace encompassing all fancied cryptocurrencies. \nThanks to their partnership with BitGo Platform, an all-in-one wallet is offered and made available once signed up. More cryptocurrencies will be added. The list will be stretched even more. They’re targeting at least 10 different cryptocurrencies to be made available before early-2018. Charging you only 1% fee for selling, Cointal allows you to register and to buy any available cryptocurrency, for free. \nAlso, this marketplace proposes multiple payment methods, for example: (Bank Transfer, Cash in Person, Credit/Debit Card, Gift Cards, Money Gram, Neteller, Paypal, Skrill, Western Union, etc.) \nHaving been scammed for too long, traders are forcibly looking for more security, more payment facilities, smoother transactions, and being able to experience the trade however they feel like without fear. Furthermore, Cointal integrates free insurance for everyone who uses their website. Anyone who suffered from a scam while using Cointal will immediately get a refund. \nThe social aspect plays an integral role for the company. Social features such as Social Chat, private messaging (without opening a trade) will be made available from day one, along with all fashionable social networks, keeping you updated and always in contact with the team. \nLooking good until now? Well, there’s more! \nGiven the fact that Cointal’s team regroups many ambitious traders, their first reflex was to get inspired by their predecessors’ marketplaces and exchange platforms. Be it design, professionalism, swiftness or promptness, Cointal has a major concern: to have all of the above incorporated in one single place. All business endeavors are fully secure and compatible with any platform. Be it phone, tablet or computer, Cointal provides a service that includes: \n– Escrow (financial arrangement where a third party holds and regulates payment of the funds required for two parties involved in a given transaction) + Feed-back system (for a better experience). – No deposit or withdrawal limits for all the cryptocurrencies.– A multi-secure wallet provided by BitGo Instant (allows on-chain, zero confirm and instant transactions between participants).– A complete support platform (Live Chat, phone number, support tickets).– An awesome affiliate program (Users earn a percentage on each transaction made by their referrals.).– Anti-hacking platform (DDoS, Phishing, hacking and social frauds, etc.) which makes the two-step verification system mandatory.– Mobile app (that will be available before fall 2017).– Worldwide service + full transparency of the team \nOn to the serious business now \nCointal offers a special treatment to the first comers. Given the fact that we haven’t launched our platform yet, we are willing to create a small and trusted community before the official launch. The First members are given some privileged advantages. 1. The first 1000 subscribers will be exempt from all charges for their first 100.000,00 USD trade volume. 2. Their profiles will be given a significant label: << Cointal Builder >> that will improve their reputation within the community. 3. They will be eligible to apply to be moderators in the social chat, the blog and even the Cointal forum. 4. In case of any problem with their account, their requests will be given first priority, without support tickets; they can instantly request a phone call to resolve their issues. 5. Once every month, three (3) of these lucky members will be randomly given 10.000,00 USD worth of BTC. \nThe website is almost ready, with some final adjustments currently being worked upon. However, you can check the gallery at the following link to see how it looks like — http://imgur.com/a/eUnN3 \nTo benefit from these special features and be one of the firsts to join their platform before the launching, they have created a subscription page. You can find the link down below. \nhttp://www.cointal.com/ Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article do not represent the views of NewsBTC or any of its team members.

Only requests for donations to large, recognized charities are allowed, and only if there is good reason to believe that the person accepting bitcoins on behalf of the charity is trustworthy. News articles that do not contain the word \"Bitcoin\" are usually off-topic. This subreddit is not about general financial news. Submissions that are mostly about some other cryptocurrency belong elsewhere. For example, /r/CryptoCurrency is a good place to discuss all cryptocurrencies. Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted. No referral links in submissions. No compilations of free Bitcoin sites. Trades should usually not be advertised here. For example, submissions like \"Buying 100 BTC\" or \"Selling my computer for bitcoins\" do not belong here. /r/Bitcoin is primarily for news and discussion. Please avoid repetition — /r/bitcoin is a subreddit devoted to new information and discussion about Bitcoin and its ecosystem. New merchants are welcome to announce their services for Bitcoin, but after those have been announced they are no longer news and should not be re-posted. Aside from new merchant announcements, those interested in advertising to our audience should consider Reddit's self-serve advertising system . Do not post your Bitcoin address unless someone explicitly asks you to. Related communities ",

According to Fortune, the coin was launched alongside a new loyalty program: For every Whopper purchased, customers will receive one Whoppercoin. However, it’s unclear if the company will accept the digital tokens as payment. \n“The Whoppercoin launched in tandem with a new loyalty program. For each Whopper burger customers purchase, they’ll receive one Whoppercoin in a special cryptocurrency wallet. While the coins’ wider use is unclear, some reports suggest that the Whoppercoin will be accepted as payment at Burger Kings across Russia.” \nBurger King’s decision comes amid a thaw in Russia’s posture toward digital currencies. After initially threatening to jail digital-currency users, the Russian government is reportedly considering legislation to legalize digital-currency payments. Earlier this month, an aid to Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that he would be seeking to raise $100 million to build a large bitcoin-mining operation with the goal of eventually claiming 30% of the bitcoin network’s hashing power. \nThe Whoppercoin was officially introduced on Aug. 22. Its introduction followed reports earlier this summer that Burger King Russia was planning to start accepting payment in bitcoin. Post navigation",

      "text": "  Bitcoin ETF Now More Likelier than Ever, Says Bloomberg Analyst Bitcoin ETF Now More Likelier than Ever, Says Bloomberg Analyst   Bitcoin ETF Now More Likelier than Ever, Says Bloomberg Analyst \nGet Trading Recommendations and Read Analysis on Hacked.com for just $39 per month. \nA bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF) is looking more likely, given recent political events, according to Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas in a recently televised “ Bloomberg Technology ” interview. \nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) earlier this year rejected the first proposed bitcoin ETF from the Winklevoss twins. \nBalchunas points to recent events that make a bitcoin ETF more likely. Why An ETF Is More Likely \nThe CBOE (Chicago Board Options Exchange) has announced it will list bitcoin futures and create a futures market, said Balchunas. \nIn early August, CNBC reported that pending review from the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the CBOE plans to offer cash-settled bitcoin futures in the fourth quarter of this year or early 2018. \nThere will also be bitcoin options, Balchunas said. “This will help bring more liquidity into the market,” he said. “That’s a big deal. I think it will help with the SEC.” \n“The second thing is the SEC itself,” he said, referring to the Trump Administration’s influence on the SEC. The new front runner for the division of investment management is an attorney from the law firm that represented the Winklevoss twins in their bid for their bitcoin ETF. “I’m not saying they will make a decision based on that, but it can’t hurt,” Balchunas said. \n“They’re a little more liberal than a year ago,” he said of the SEC. ‘Ready For Prime Time’ \n“When you approve an ETF for something, you’re essentially making it ready for prime time, because anybody with an e-trade account can now buy it,” Balchunas said. “It’s a lot easier than going out and signing up for a bitcoin account on one of the exchanges.” \n“It’s also good for bitcoin because it’s going to open up a world of new investors,” he said, comparing it to what the GLD ETF did with gold, which is now a $40 billion ETF. The Winklevoss bitcoin ETF was modeled on GLD. \n“It’s going to store bitcoin just like GLD stores gold and make it easier for investors to access it,” he said. \nAlso read: SEC suspends trading of publicly listed bitcoin firm CFTC Authorizes Clearing House \nThe CFTC in July granted LedgerX, LLC registration as a digital currency derivatives clearing organization under the Commodity Exchange Act. LedgerX is authorized to provide clearing services for fully-collateralized digital currency swaps. LedgerX was also approved as a swap execution facility (SEF) on July 6, 2017, making it the first federally regulated SEF allowed to offer clearing services and a trading facility for options based on digital currency for the institutional market. \nThe SEC finding in July that DAO tokens are a security, and subject to federal securities laws was welcomed by cryptocurrency industry observers as an indication the agency is developing laws to apply to cryptocurrencies. The finding was part of an SEC report on its investigation into the DAO ICO. \nFeatured image from Shutterstock.",

I would like to have a software developed to help automate my trading. \nThe software would purchase, trade, sell and store cryptocurrencies across various exchanges based on specific parameters which I would provide to you in advance. \nWe would discuss and fine tune basic algorithms which I would provide to you then you would create a software which I would own full 100% of all rights to, to run with the algorithms in real world cryptocurrency trading on exchanges such as [url removed, login to view] and bittrex.com. \nFor the first milestone of the project I want you to help me create the software parameters in a detailed document form to clarify the scope of work fully. This will be helpful in ensuring we are both on the same page with expectations and requirements before we get too far along to go back.",

      "text": "Community guidelines Do not use URL shortening services: always submit the real link. Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins. Only requests for donations to large, recognized charities are allowed, and only if there is good reason to believe that the person accepting bitcoins on behalf of the charity is trustworthy. News articles that do not contain the word \"Bitcoin\" are usually off-topic. This subreddit is not about general financial news. Submissions that are mostly about some other cryptocurrency belong elsewhere. For example, /r/CryptoCurrency is a good place to discuss all cryptocurrencies. Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted. No referral links in submissions. No compilations of free Bitcoin sites. Trades should usually not be advertised here. For example, submissions like \"Buying 100 BTC\" or \"Selling my computer for bitcoins\" do not belong here. /r/Bitcoin is primarily for news and discussion. Please avoid repetition — /r/bitcoin is a subreddit devoted to new information and discussion about Bitcoin and its ecosystem. New merchants are welcome to announce their services for Bitcoin, but after those have been announced they are no longer news and should not be re-posted. Aside from new merchant announcements, those interested in advertising to our audience should consider Reddit's self-serve advertising system . Do not post your Bitcoin address unless someone explicitly asks you to. Related communities ",

Hi, \nI’m looking for an expert iOS (swift native) developer with knowledge of cryptocurrencies trading to code the app below \nTweet trader iOS app \nLog in to your twitter profile \nFollow/unfollow people from twitter app, no need to have functionality in the app \nEvery x minutes (setup in settings) Parse tweets from people you follow (not retweets) \nWhen a string matches a coin identifier or a name of a coin available from one of the supported exchanges (get a list of coins , three letters code and full name on launch ... Btc bitcoin, eth ethereum from each supported exchange) , display a notification on the phone , once clicked (expire old notifications after x minutes ) setup a market buy order (fill or kill) for x btc (x can be defaulted for each exchange in the settings) also add buttons for standard quantities if you want to override the default (10,20,30,50% of btc balance on that exchange but also 0.1,0.2,0.5,1,1.5,2,2.5,5 btc), on the same setup window show balance of btc and the coin being traded , show graph with 1 5 30 1d intervals (default to 1min), user has to press execute button to send order to the market (give option to close the proposed order if you don’t want to trade it ) \nAlso if enabled in the settings once the buy is fully executed , auto setup a market sell for x%gain (auto sell all of the available quantity when price reaches buy price +x% (if enabled, this is automatically sent to the market) \nHandle multiple concurrent tweets, create like a queue of proposed order so the user can go trough them one by one \nFilter strings in settings if you don’t want to trade specific coins (ignore xrp, ignore ripple and so on) \nAdd settings for twitter api and crypto api (stored locally on device) \nSupported Exchanges Bittrex \nWill add poloniex and others in v2 \nMaster switch for each exchange to stop the bot",
