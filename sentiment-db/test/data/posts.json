    "text": "10 Top Cryptocurrency Investors Share Their Favorite Long Term Picks 08/24/2017 09:20 am ET Updated 4 hours ago Licensed from Adobe Stock 730 \nThere’s a lot of focus right now on short-term speculation in the cryptocurrency space. But at some undefined future point, a reversal from speculation to value is going to happen. And when it does, you’ll want to be in the right positions. \nInvesting exclusively in tokens with real world value creation is the philosophy that my crypto hedge fund, General Crypto , is predicated on. Unless you’re a skilled day trader and don’t mind incredible stress levels, it’s wise to buy-and-hold coins with game-changing value rather than just jumping to and from the flavor of the week. \nAnalyzing the validity of that value isn’t easy. So I thought it would be interesting to hear what some very smart people who dedicate themselves full-time to crypto are betting on in the long-term. \nHere are each of their top three picks that they intend to hold (and not decrease position size) for at least the next two years, and why they believe in them so much. \nFood for thought: there is estimated to be around 100 crypto hedge funds currently spinning up in Q3 and Q4 2017. 100! Our fund was featured on Forbes as one of 15. This means a massive on-ramp of institutional capital — the likes of which crypto has never seen before — is about to be opened. And smart money is going to pick the smart cryptos. Here is what myself and nine others think they are going to back. Logan Kugler , Managing Partner at General Crypto \nI’ll start with my three favorite. \nRIPPLE ( XRP ) — Ripple is going after SWIFT, and their token XRP could entirely change the way we send money internationally. Why? Currently money takes days to move internationally, and the fees are enormous. There’s literally no way today to send money from one country to another same-day, other than by boarding a plane with a suitcase full of cash. XRP can transfer value (read: money) anywhere in the world in four seconds, at a cost of pennies . And unlike other coins, it doesn’t get bogged down when hit by huge volume. \nWhy am I bullish? The market size is as big as it gets (SWIFT moves $5 trillion USD per day ), the technology is already built (Ripple has been working on it since 2012), their team is world-class, and nearly 100 banking partnerships are already in place with pilots running or about to start. The CEO of SBI Holdings believes XRP will become the global standard in digital currencies. \nBitcoin maximalists like saying that XRP is not a true crypto because it’s not decentralized. The reality is Ripple is working towards making XRP even more decentralized than Bitcoin. It could take a while, but they’re already off to a good start . \nWhat some people miss about XRP is the timeline. Ripple stands to revolutionize the entire banking industry. That’s not going to happen overnight. It will have its rallies and its steep corrections, but I expect it to consistently go up. Don’t buy this one expecting big things to happen as fast as other coins. (And don’t get cold feet when it drops half.) The key difference is that XRP is predicated on an extremely strong use case, team, and technology. Be willing to buy now and hold this token for minimally the next five years and I think you’ll see an incredible return on investment. If you want a simple way to think about Ripple: XRP is going to let us move money across borders in the same way that we move information across them today. And that’s an astronomical upside. \nHere’s a long article I wrote about XRP if you’re interested in knowing more. \nPrice when this published: $0.266 \nFACTOM ( FCT ) — Factom offers the promise of immutable records. This could be huge for the (trillion-dollar) mortgage industry , banks and audit records, retail with huge databases like Target, studios with enormous catalogs of movies like Warner Bros., and governments for historical documents. Factom’s competitions are currently bounded by only proving the positive (e.g. “can we show X has existed in the chain?”), which would pertain to proof of existence, integrity, ownership, etc. — which is limited for the overall problem they are trying to solve. Factom can prove both the positive and the negative and see if a piece of information didn’t exist at a certain period in time, or whether it’s the latest version. Factom could change how major record keepers keep records and ensure eternal existence of all records. \nPrice when this published: $25.61 \nMONERO ( XMR ) — One of the original promises of Bitcoin was anonymity. It turns out it’s not quite as anonymous as a lot of people initially think. While who owns a particular wallet address is unknown, the transactions can be easily followed. So if your identity gets associated with a wallet address, some analysis can essentially turn your transactions into public bank statements. Enter anonymous coins (or “anon coins”), of which XMR is leading the field in privacy. It scrambles your address automatically each time, so you don’t have to worry about leaving a trail. I can see Monero XMR becoming very popular among those seeking anonymous transactions. What’s still up in the air is whether or not it can scale. Within hours of writing, XMR experienced a 50% price surge, which saw vastly extended transaction times. \nPrice when this published: $83.59 Spencer Bogart , Managing Director and Head of Research at Blockchain Capital \nBITCOIN ( BTC ) — Bitcoin has proven its ability to efficiently serve a few use cases that represent giant market opportunities. Amazon first proved it could efficiently sell things online and it focused on this ability before growing into other opportunities. I think the same will be true of Bitcoin. \nPrice when this published: $4,180 \nMONERO ( XMR ) — If I were forced to pick one thing that I was most concerned about for Bitcoin, it would be a lack of privacy. Each Bitcoin should be worth as much as any other Bitcoin, regardless of who owned it before you or what they did with it. For now, this isn’t a big problem. But Monero is a good hedge against this risk, since it’s more private than Bitcoin and therefore doesn’t have the same degree of fungibility risk. \nLITECOIN ( LTC ) — Silver to Bitcoin’s gold. The code is so similar to Bitcoin that Litecoin is able to leverage Bitcoin’s developer network and improvements. This is a big advantage over other coins that try to build a developer community from the ground up. If anything catastrophic happened to Bitcoin, a decent portion of the capital would likely flow to Litecoin. \nPrice when this published: $51.63 Rafe Furst , Chief Investment Officer at The Crypto Company \nDASH ( DASH ) — Bitcoin’s reign as the gateway cryptocurrency is coming to an end. The question is, what will replace it? Arguments can be made for Litecoin, Zcash, Ripple, or Monero. I like Dash because of its focus on consumer-friendliness and its flexible, decentralized governance protocol. For example, it took just 24 hours for the Dash community to approve a proposed blocksize increase back in 2016, while the Bitcoin community took three years to address its scalability problems, and the debate ended in a hard fork. \nPrice when this published: $296.56 \nETHEREUM ( ETH ) — While Ethereum won’t replace the function of Bitcoin, it will continue to play the important role it currently does as a smart-contract engine, and as a master blockchain to spawn new application tokens. \nPrice when this published: $324.99 \nSTEEM ( STEEM ) — Imagine if your social media posts could earn you money based on how popular they were. Imagine if you could get paid as tastemaker and curator of content published by others. Now what if the content creators kept 100% of the ownership rights to their content, and there were no advertisers or special interests getting between creators and fans? Steem is the first utility token that is truly being used for this function. Platforms like Reddit, Medium, and even Facebook should be nervous. \nPrice when this published: $1.25 Brad Mills , Fund Strategist at Alphabit \nBITCOIN ( BTC ) — I’ve been holding Bitcoin since 2011 when I started mining in my basement, and I will keep holding until it’s at least $100,000 per coin, which I expect in three to five years. Fundamentally strong, this is the original blockchain that is and was designed to be money. \nI get excited when I see Bitcoin becoming legal tender in countries like Japan, South Korea, and India. It's only a matter of time before a Bitcoin ETF is approved, and we see sovereign wealth and endowment funds allocating money into Bitcoin as a new asset class. \nMETAL ( MTL ) — Metal is one of Alphabit’s core positions that we will be holding long-term. Currently, it sits at only a $190 million market cap, which we think could grow to $1 billion or greater over the next year. Metal has the dual-use case of being not only a crypto-rewards token and peer-to-peer payments app like Venmo, but also an FDIC-insured fiat on-ramp bank in your pocket for the average person to make it easy to use cryptocurrency. For a competitor in market cap, I look at Dash which is currently at $2.3 billion, and also focusing on mass user adoption. \nPrice when this published: $8.78 \nWAVES ( WAVES ) — Waves is Russia's largest blockchain project. At it's core, it's a decentralized exchange and user-created token fundraising platform, forked from the NXT codebase. An ICO was held in 2016 that raised $16 million, which has grown to a market cap of over $300 million. \nThis month, a partnership was announced between Gazprombank and Waves. The partnership focuses on holding ICOs for Russian mining and metals companies, bringing a lot of legitimacy to the platform. \nPrice when this published: $4.64 CryptoYoda , well-respected cryptocurrency trader on Twitter \nLITECOIN ( LTC ) — It’s the second oldest and most trusted blockchain to date, and in addition to being about four times faster than Bitcoin, it has successfully managed to activate Segwit well before any blocksize debate, which to me is a sign of positive adaptability. For being a fork of Bitcoin with only minor differences in algorithm, trading at about 1.5% of Bitcoin's value is utterly insane, given it’s a more convenient payment coin. Bitcoin will primarily be a store-of-value, just as silver versus gold. \nETHEREUM CLASSIC ( ETC ) — The reason ETC’s price is so low compared to Ethereum (ETH) is the confusion about what happened during the hardfork a year ago. In July 2016, the community decided to hard fork the Ethereum blockchain in order to restore lost funds of DAO investors by rolling back the blockchain to a point in time before the hack. \nThere was huge resistance in the Ethereum community because of their devotion to the immutability of blockchains. Part of the community decided to violate that “law” to bail out those affected by the DAO hack, creating ETH. ETC is currently trading at 14.3% of ETH's value, which is a severe undervaluation in my eyes, given it's loyalty towards the core principle of cryptocurrency. \nPrice when this published: $15.51 \nZCASH ( ZEC ) — There are many undervalued coins offering anonymity to users, with Zcash and Monero being the most prominent. I think Zcash is positioned to be one of the biggest winners. It has huge interest, is elaborately designed, and has a high-security creation process and very limited supply. Its lack of recent price advancement indicates to me that traders are accumulating it. \nPrice when this published: $231.04 Romano , well-respected cryptocurrency trader on Twitter; also the lead developer of Viacoin (VIA) \nSTRATIS ( STRAT ) — Stratis makes blockchain easy for enterprise. They offer simple and affordable end-to-end solutions for development, testing and deployment of native C# blockchain applications. Ever see an article that talks about a bank starting to use blockchain technology? They don't use the Bitcoin blockchain, but a private chain like Stratis. Stratis makes it easier than ever before for organizations to deploy private blockchains. They’re in talks with many huge companies like Microsoft, Jaguar, Reuters, Cashaa, AIA Group, RBC Capital Markets, Deutsche Bank, etc. \nPrice when this published: $6.09 \nDECRED ( DCR ) — Decred will soon get the Lightening Network. Which means you can send small transactions for almost no fee, instantly. The Lightening Network is a big thing which many underestimate. Notable about Decred is that they’ve learned and implemented a lot from the success of Dash. But whereas Dash has a lot of outside funding (and is accountable to investors), Decred is self-funded via block subsidy (accountable only to its users) and they are entirely transparent about the allocations. Decred has decentralized voting, Charlie Lee (Litecoin’s lead developer) on their team, and their code looks clean and is beautifully written. \nPrice when this published: $29.97 \nZCOIN ( XZC ) — While a lot of other anonymous coins bill themselves as completely anonymous, they are not, as this video explains . This is also a great article explaining why most anon coins aren’t actually completely anonymous. Only ZCoin is completely anonymous and I think at some point the market will recognize that and it will be in the same league market cap wise as Monero. Right now, ZCoin looks very undervalued to me as their market cap is only $26 million (compared to Monero’s $1.2 billion). Also worth noting: Roger Ver has said good things about ZCoin (and I don't like Roger Ver at all, but he has very deep pockets). \nPrice when this published: $9.55 CryptoVisionary , founder of the Phoenix Trading Group \nRIPPLE ( XRP ) — Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), the technology that powers Ripple and its associated coin XRP, allows anyone anywhere in the world to transact money in the same way as sending data (at fractions of the cost). For markets such as international remittance, this means monumental change is underway. ($500 billion is transacted yearly in the remittance sector.) Many of the largest banks in the world (more than 100) have plans to leverage DLT and Ripple to cut costs for their payment servicing. In fact, even the Federal Reserve and the Central Bank of England are testing out Ripple for real-time payment capabilities. \nAUGUR ( REP ) — Businesses around the world pay a high premium for actionable intelligence for their own internal and strategic needs. With Augur, anyone in the world can obtain information on the probability of a future event. Think of it as the Google search for future events, peering into the future using a fascinating principle known as wisdom of the crowd. Such a technology could drastically impact many industries, including trillion-dollar or larger industries like gambling and sports betting. \nPrice when this published: $22.59 \nQTUM ( QTUM ) — Think of Qtum like an Ethereum for China, except that it's a Proof of Stake coin. It’s a more environmentally friendly way to secure the network, with a drastic reduction in the consumption of electricity compared to Proof of Work systems like Bitcoin. Like Ethereum, Qtum will host a number of applications developed by independent third parties, has an all-star cast in terms of advisors (one of their co-founders was recently cited in Forbes China’s “30 Under 30” list.) \nPrice when this published: $13.49 notsofast , well-respected cryptocurrency trader on Twitter \nBLOCKNET ( BLOCK ) — Of all projects competing to release a decentralized, native cryptocurrency exchange, Blocknet's technology is far and away the strongest, easiest to implement, and closest to market. \nBlocknet removes the third-party risk in sending your coins to trade on an exchange. You can collateralize 5,000 blocknet in a service node, run any wallets you want on the same machine as that node, and earn BLOCK in trade fees whenever someone trades a currency your node supports. The blocknet protocol will fundamentally advance the use of blockchains the way IE or Netscape standardized and unlocked the World Wide Web. \nPrice when this published: $14.12 \nUBIQ ( UBQ ) — The DAO philosophical failure and Ethereum network split opened the door to competitors on smart contract blockchains. Ubiq is the strongest: immutable unlike ETH, and with a brand focus away from experimentation and toward corporate professionalism. Once the Ethereum ICO craze breaks and that platform loses trust, Ubiq's secure network and failure-free track record will present it as a viable smart contract competitor. \nPrice when this published: $1.55 \nPARKBYTE ( PKB ) (Soon to be ParkChain; PKC) — Parkbyte is my appcoin bet. It's a simple premise to disrupt a ubiquitous and unsexy industry with better tracking, standardized UX, and lower costs and efficiency throughout. Via industry experience, the developers acutely understands exactly what needs to be pitched to whom in order to disrupt existing pay-to-park systems with a blockchain implementation. \nPrice when this published: $0.278 Squeeze , well-respected cryptocurrency trader on Twitter \nCIVIC ( CVC ) — Civic is a secure identity platform that uses the Civic tokens for identification purposes. Vinny Lingham is the CEO of Civic and he's one of the \"Sharks\" on Shark Tank South Africa. Civic has both the concept and the team. With Vinny's connections and influence, many sites have already integrated Civic. For this type of identity verification, user adoption is very important. Without adoption, there's no use case. \nPrice when this published: $0.546 \nTEZOS (TEZ) — By far, the biggest ICO funding, with $230 million. It has huge names backing it like billionaire Tim Draper. Their algorithm runs on a delegated proof of stake system. It is also capable of anonymous transactions which utilizes the Zcash's proof circuit on a side token. They have plans to replace this process with a better option in the future. It is also possible to create applications on Tezos similar to Ethereum. I have no doubt that it will hit a multibillion market cap in a year. \nPrice when this published: (not publicly traded yet) \nLISK ( LSK ) — This is one of the underdogs that a lot of people missed. It's currently at $233 million market cap. Lisk (similar to Tezos) is utilizing the Delegated Proof of Stake system, where \"delegates\" verify the transactions and have voting capabilities that steer the direction of Lisk. \nThe main development plan this year is to create an SDK for developing and deploying blockchain applications (smart contracts). They have a strong development team and they have sufficient funds ($62 million) to keep it going for tens of years. \nPrice when this published: $3.42 sicarious , well-respected cryptocurrency trader on Twitter \nDECRED ( DCR ) — Decred is perhaps the most innovative Proof of Stake coin on the market today, and boasts an impressive (and production ready) decentralized governance system. In addition to governance solutions, Decred is preparing to throw their hat into the ring of anonymous transactions later this year. The Bitcoin scaling debate and increasing government scrutiny of the cryptocurrency ecosystem emphasize the importance of both governance and anonymity, setting the stage for Decred’s growth through the end of 2017 and 2018. \nUBIQ ( UBQ ) — Ubiq has an upgraded codebase, newly-designed difficulty algorithm, monetary policy, and several million-dollar projects running as tokens on its chain. Additionally, it was launched in a spirit of fairness with zero ICO or developer premine. Currently valued at less than 0.5% of ETH’s market cap, Ubiq provides a top-tier alternative to ETH at a dramatically cheaper rate. \nBASIC ATTENTION TOKEN ( BAT ) — The free and open internet as we know it runs on advertisements, and yet adblockers are seeing increasing adoption among internet users. BAT seeks to solve this problem by creating a mutually beneficial common ground between advertisers and users, centered around their internet browser, Brave. \nPrice when this published: $0.200 Licensed from Adobe Stock \nNotice: None of the information contained in this article is investment advice.

    "text": "GlobeNewswire - Print release Exante launches XAI, the world's first altcoin fund EXANTE, the European fintech firm that made history in 2012 by launching the world's first Bitcoin hedge fund, is once again shaking up the investment industry. Today the Malta-headquartered company launched a dedicated altcoin index, XAI, which reflects the dynamics of the altcoin world (all cryptocurrencies minus Bitcoin). The XAI-Fund, which is available to EXANTE clients immediately, follows the index, to profit from the rise in prices of most altcoins in an easy safe and regulated way. The XAI index is made up of nearly all available popular alternative cryptocurrencies. Anatoliy Knyazev, co-founder of EXANTE elaborated: 'Just a couple of weeks ago we launched separate funds for Ripple, Ethereum. Monero, Zcash and Litecoin - which was a huge success. We did notice an additional demand from clients who don't have the time or the technological means to deep-dive and analyze each currency separately - but do want to profit from the bullish altcoin markets. XAI is the solution to that problem.' EXANTE clients can trade XAI fund shares are regular exchange traded instruments and they are accessible via the general trading platform. This platform gives traders direct access to more than 50 thousand financial products and nearly all financial markets. Trading in these products, is regulated by the MFSA and audited by KPMG, adding a layer of security normally missing from the unregulated cryptocurrency market. Besides the aforementioned altcoins, the XAI-index also tracks Ethereum Classic. 'We decided to leave out Bitcoin,' said Knyazev, 'since it has less fat left on its bone. Ripple and Monero, for example, nearly doubled in value recently. That's what makes investing in the XAI fund so interesting and exciting.' -END-",

    "text": "Business and Finance daily market ltc NEWS Prediction No Comments \nIn the previous writing related to Litecoin Price development, we mentioned for further gains, a breakout over the $50 is required which even happened in the last 24 hours. The Digital currency was spiking in increase aiming to reach and set a new all-time high record but the catapulting stopped at $54.78. However in the positive note, it had stable ground and hovered over the $50 trending line. \nThe 24 hour trading volume for Litecoin is $619.6, only behind of Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple – Based on CoinmarketCap. Even like in other cases like Monero , ETC , Ripple that last days South Korean trading/exchanging platforms leading with 20.4% leaving behind Chinese ones like OkCoin and Huobi. \nSource Coinmarketcap \nExcept that in general the market relating to different cryptocurrencies has been spiking there is no specific reason for Litecoin surge yesterday. Only adding that the team is working in several significant features to be installed in the platform. The Litecoin community is eagerly anticipating the inclusion of cross-chain atomic swaps between LTC and BTC in the near future. On top of that implementing its own version of the Lightening Network, could dramatically increase transaction speeds. \nMovements like the first to adopt Segregated Witness on the scaling upgrade, have shown how Charile Lee the creator wants to improve the heavily-influenced by the original platform Litecoin. LTC is often even even called “The Silver side of Gold Bitcoin” reflecting how much they are similar. Maybe the community positive energy that results of the hard work for improvement is keeping the digital currency upwards. \nTrading today – the Litecoin price stood at $51.10, as of 15:51 BST. The cryptocurrency has gained 5.10% over the past 24 hours, according to Coinmarketcap. \nRead Also: ",

    "title": "Brokerage Company EXANTE Launches First Altcoin Index-based Investment Fund",
    "text": "16 Views \nMalta-based brokerage company EXANTE has launched a fund based on altcoin index. We have just launched the first investment fund based on a #cryptocurrency index. Meet https://t.co/osLH8Dk85k, exclusive at #EXANTE Sponsored Links \n— EXANTE (@EXANTE_EU) 24 August 2017 \nUnderlying the XAI.Fund is XNT Altcoin Index (XAI). Currently it supports six main altcoins: Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Ripple, Monero, Litecoin, and ZCash. The company explained this choice by the fact that said altcoins account for 30% of the entire market. \n“We intentionally did not include Bitcoin in the index: thus, our market cap weighted index became even more promising,” the company’s statement reads. \nInitially, management of those assets will be available via a personal manager, yet the company intends to bring the option to their trading platform as well. The fee will comprise 0.5% of the transaction’s amount, with the minimal lot being 0.001 of the index as expressed in USD. EXANTE noted that the fund features safe storage of assets and management via a brokerage account. \n“Besides, with XAI.Fund corporate clients now have a capability to legally invest into cryptocurrencies without experiencing problems with accounting or taxation,” the statement goes on. \nThe cryptocurrencies listed above have been added to EXANTE this June for the purpose of standard trading at the same account and platform used for shares, ETF, derivatives and other financial instruments. \nAnatoliy Knyazev, co-founder of EXANTE elaborated: \n“Just a couple of weeks ago we launched separate funds for Ripple, Ethereum. Monero, Zcash and Litecoin – which was a huge success. We did notice an additional demand from clients who don’t have the time or the technological means to deep-dive and analyze each currency separately – but do want to profit from the bullish altcoin markets. XAI is the solution to that problem.”",

    "title": "So, you want to start or invest in a Blockchain crypto fund? Part I/II",
    "text": "Fintech VC @ Illuminate Financial Based In London Aug 16 So, you want to start or invest in a Blockchain crypto fund? Part I/II This post reflects only my personal views on the current crypto fund market. Like anyone working in Fintech VC, I have been trying to make sense of the recent crypto craze. The first part highlights the different challenges around pre-trade, execution and post-trade, and is designed for all my banker / Hedge Fund friends who think they can apply their skill set to crypto. The second part will highlight my view on the current crypto fund landscape. I may be wrong, but thought it would be great to share this and to gather feedback. PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS. Also, I am very happy to have a chat or share notes, just email me at ebrunet40@gmail.com The total crypto market cap reached $132BN , Filecoin ICO raised $200m in 60mn and c rypto helped Nvidia beat its own guidance for the most recent quarter . Even CNBC Africa launched a new program called Crypto Trader . What happened over the last few months? I have no idea if we are in a bubble but lots of money is going into the crypto space; companies who could not raise VC money and sometimes without a working product are launching Initial Coin Offering (ICO) and even the SEC has released an investor bulletin about ICO including some key points to consider when determining whether to participate in an ICO . I guess the market is hot . Even coinmarketcap has more reads than the WSJ. Coinmarketcap is now ranked higher than WSJ on Alexa. Go crypto! Last spring saw a surge in the price of the Bitcoin and Ethereum, driven by geopolitical and economic reasons including, among others, Trump’s presidency, rising debt levels and new crypto friendly regulations in China and Japan . The price increase led many early Bitcoin and Ether investors to suddenly have a large war chest composed of mainly Bitcoin and Ether, worth from a few hundreds to a few millions of dollars. Most of the early adopters decided to embrace a classic early stage investment strategy named “Spray and Pray”, investing in as many ICOs as possible in order to gain exposure to at least a few successful ones which would return their total investment. Such a strategy does not require investors to perform in depth due diligence (which is good because it is really hard to assess a pre-product, pre-team and sometimes pre-whitepaper company). Here it is a numbers game. For this reason, many companies who struggled in the past to raise VC funding turned to ICO as they could easily raise a few millions dollars. Source: https://mgstover.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/HFA_071217_DigitalCurrency-1.pdf At the same time, the mainstream public started to hear about stories of people becoming millionaires by investing in crypto ( some even wrote a book ) and companies raising millions with only a website and whitepaper written in LaTex . The influx of Retail investors and HNWIs wanting not to miss their chance to become a UHNWI has pushed the total crypto total market cap to a new high. Results? $1.7bn and counting raised from ICOs and a $130bn+ Crypto market cap. Crap. I should have listened to my Bitcoin enthusiast cousin in 2013. So what’s next? Well some people see an opportunity as classic institutional investors are not yet equipped to invest in crypto currencies. At the same time, HNWI, family offices, private banks and others are looking to gain exposure to this new asset class. Just in case… you know... it becomes huge. Hence, anyone wishing to be in the crypto space has two options. Either start their own crypto fund, or start a company and do an ICO as soon as possible. The rest of the post will cover the first option, crypto funds. 1- Pre-Trade. Execution. Post-Trade. Regulation. This is for all my banker and PE/VCs friends who think it is easy to setup a crypto fund. It is not. 2- Crypto fund Landscape. For anyone interested in learning more who is in and who is not. [To be published end of August 2017] Enjoy. Pre-Trade. Execution. Post-Trade. Regulation. Say What? As TwoBitIdiot highlights in his post Losing Alpha: Why Most New Crypto Funds Are a Sh*t Deal , it is fairly easy to see the main arguments that crypto hedge fund wannabes use in their pitch. The crypto market is large and growing extremely quickly, but not without regulation, compliance and custody processes. As the market is not yet fully regulated anyone can use insider information (not sure I would recommend that one, though). Howeover, as the crypto market remains opaque for most people, there is an opportunity for savvy Bitcointalk readers to monetise their knowledge. Pre-Trade: Goodbye Bloomberg. Hello Reddit. Pre-trade refers broadly describes the analysis leading to the selection of a specific token / crypto currencies. First you need to build an investment thesis. For example, MetaStable is investing into digital currencies like Bitcoin, Monero etc. Not ICO / Token per se. They have written an awesome blog posts about it. Great, you have a thesis. Good for you. Next step, how do you select companies / currencies / tokens? Here you don’t have Bloomberg, no investor relation page (yet), only a few sell-side research house (The Goldman Sachs of crypto: Smith+Crown ). One needs to gather intel from slack channels (e.g. Coinfund ), listen to specialised podcasts (E.g. EpiCenter ), follow niche news websites (e.g. Coindesk ), read on forum like Reddit . Once you have done that you need to build relationships with the team. For example have you been to the last Token Summit or Devcon2? Let’s say you have a team of research analysts with a good understanding of the Blockchain. You nailed it. Great, but do you have data scientists with blockchain background? That is hard to find. Even Polychain is looking for one . Imagine you find one. He / She would need to build connectivity with different exchanges to gather historical / live data (or use Kaiko or Coinigy ) to be able to perform quantitative analysis. In addition, to quant and fundamental research analysts you also need to have people with deep cryptography expertise. Finding talents who understand what is an ERC20 token and what impact the Plasma project may have on Ethereum is not easy. Even less easy when people with such knowledge could most likely do an ICO and raise millions. Execution. I still miss Bloomberg. Where is my broker? Execution differs if you are investing pre-ICO or post-ICO. The first is quite straight forward. A company asks you to transfer either BTC, ETH or LTC to a certain address and in exchange you will receive a certain number of tokens post-ICO. Recent ICOs use Coinlist to make things even easier and regulated. They often happen with a discount of 10 to 80%. This is great but you need to have access to these deals. As TwoBitIdiot explained, the Polychain and BlueYard Capital of the world will be in this deal. Not you. Game over. How about Post-ICO? Here you need to build relationships and order flow connectivity with as many exchanges as you can. I would say at least 15. Ari Paul from Blocktower has 20+ . In addition, you need to find a reliable OTC broker. There are only a handful in the world that are recognised and legit like Genesis Trading from DCG . Note, even with strong relationships there is no insurance that you can get access to liquidity to buy / sell your tokens. It is different when you want to sell $2m than when you sell $20k. Moreover, there is always a counter party risk when you do business with a private exchange / OTC broker… Some other questions to keep in mind: What is your risk management? How do you deal with pumps and dumps? Are there good enough measures of VaR etc. for those markets? Very different than investing in private securities, right? Or when you bought Apple shares on Charles Schwab , right? Post-trade. Where is my custodian? Cold or hot wallet? You bought your Bitcoin or other coins / tokens. What do you do with it? JPMorgan Chase does not provide token custody. Would you let $10m+ worth of coins sit in your ledger wallet ? What is an air-gapped compute r and is it really safe ( apparently not )? Do you store your coins at your offices? Do you use Xapo as a custodian? What if you need to do a “quick” trade and you need to have some coins stored on exchanges? Is that ok? Regulation. The major systemic risk. The recent judgement on the DAO cas e was not a surprise for anyone involved in the crypto land. What was surprising was the detailed level of understanding of the SEC. Read the DAO report of investigation . It is super well written and comprehensive. From my view the main takeaway is that the SEC understands the ICO market quite well and there is a high chance that new regulations will come in the next 12 months. Some exchanges may have to stop trading certain tokens and will need to perform serious KYC checks. A good example is the recent news from Bitfinex ( Suspension of U.S. Individual Verification Requests and Bitfinex will be barring U.S. customers from trading ERC20 tokens issued through “ICOs ). You get the point. Pre-trade, Execution and Post-trade is not straightforward. It is not rocket science but you need proper resources, an acute awareness of the evolving regulatory situation and of course, some blockchain knowledge. Summary of the questions for each stage that one needs to think about for their crypto fund. If you like my post don’t forget to forward it, recommend it, add comments and share it with your friends.

The crypto currency wallet has to be treated as your primary email account in terms of security. Bitcoins and ethereum blockchain is so big that creating a local wallet and recovering in case of a system crash is big headache. We have many other cryptocurrencies that can be exchanged with bitcoins. Monero coins are now trending higher. I personally prefer AEON coin as its price is less at present and has potential to move like monero. Creating a local wallet and syncing is faster that monero. Transaction fee and confirmation time is also less.",

    "text": "EXANTE, the European fintech firm that made history in 2012 by launching the world's first Bitcoin hedge fund, is once again shaking up the investment industry. Today the Malta-headquartered company launched a dedicated altcoin index, XAI, which reflects the dynamics of the altcoin world (all cryptocurrencies minus Bitcoin). The XAI-Fund, which is available to EXANTE clients immediately, follows the index, to profit from the rise in prices of most altcoins in an easy safe and regulated way. The XAI index is made up of nearly all available popular alternative cryptocurrencies.\n\nAnatoliy Knyazev, co-founder of EXANTE elaborated: 'Just a couple of weeks ago we launched separate funds for Ripple, Ethereum. Monero, Zcash and Litecoin - which was a huge success. We did notice an additional demand from clients who don't have the time or the technological means to deep-dive and analyze each currency separately - but do want to profit from the bullish altcoin markets. XAI is the solution to that problem.'\n\nEXANTE clients can trade XAI fund shares are regular exchange traded instruments and they are accessible via the general trading platform. This platform gives traders direct access to more than 50 thousand financial products and nearly all financial markets. Trading in these products, is regulated by the MFSA and audited by KPMG, adding a layer of security normally missing from the unregulated cryptocurrency market.\n\nBesides the aforementioned altcoins, the XAI-index also tracks Ethereum Classic. 'We decided to leave out Bitcoin,' said Knyazev, 'since it has less fat left on its bone. Ripple and Monero, for example, nearly doubled in value recently. That's what makes investing in the XAI fund so interesting and exciting.'\n\n*-END-*\n\n*For further information contact:*\nThijs Plug\nHead of Content\nT: +356 2015 0000\nE: plug@exante.eu\n\n*Note to editors*\n\nAbout EXANTE:\nEXANTE is a European investment company established in 2011.

    "text": "Browse: Home Mainstream Bitcoin Standpoint Founder: Bitcoin Asset Class Will Grow Into $2 Trillion Market Standpoint Founder: Bitcoin Asset Class Will Grow Into $2 Trillion Market   Standpoint Founder: Bitcoin Asset Class Will Grow Into $2 Trillion Market \nForget $5,000. \nAt a time when many are making short-term bets on the price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, one bitcoin bull is going a step further. Ronnie Moas, founder of Standpoint Research, is making the case cryptocurrencies will not only be a decade-long trend, but a viable asset class. \nIn fact, he’s going so far as to call for a massive rise in the market cap of cryptocurrencies. His prediction? The total value of all cryptographic assets, today valued at $150 billion , will soar to $2 trillion over the next 10 years. \nAnd in a new interview, Moas walked CoinDesk through his forecast, explaining how it stems from his fundamental analysis of the capital markets and the broader macroeconomic trends he now sees in place. \nThe Standpoint founder’s view stands in stark contrast to the highly bearish analysis of Peter Schiff, who called cryptocurrency a bubble, a speculative frenzy and a natural Ponzi scheme driven by “just plain greed” last week. \nIn the broadest sense, Moas sees the current state of the cryptocurrency market as a direct parallel to Silicon Valley during the 1990s, when a massive surge of innovation created new technologies that transformed the way we work and live and ushered in a period of massive wealth creation. \nHe explained: \n“I am not any more concerned with bitcoin being at a record high than Amazon or Google investors were concerned when those share prices jumped hundreds of percent and hit $100 and $200 many years ago. Today, both of those stocks are above $900. The question is not where we are at – it is where are we going? I do not think we are in a bubble.” Roadmap to $2 trillion \nHow does Moas get to the $2 trillion market cap for cryptocurrency in his forecast? \nHe begins by looking at the $200 trillion that is currently invested in the global capital markets today, including all major asset classes: cash, stocks, bonds and gold. Moas, who also does traditional equity analysis, begins his market breakdown with stocks, which he believes are currently overvalued. \nAccording to Moas, three-quarters of the names in the S&P 500 are trading at least 18 times earnings, which is higher than his value threshold of 12 times earnings. He also adds that we haven’t had a stock market correction in 20 months. \nOn the currency front, the U.S. dollar is currently losing 1–2 percent per year due to inflation. Moas also points out that the dollar has lost half its value since he was in high school 35 years ago. \nFrom a global perspective, where most people don’t have access to U.S. dollars, Moas believes the case for cryptocurrency is even more compelling: \n“Now, imagine what they think of their own local currencies elsewhere in the world. Imagine you live in Venezuela and you’re keeping your money under the mattress. Would you rather leave it there in Venezuelan bolivar or would you rather put it in bitcoin? It’s not going to take you very long to make that decision.” \nBreaking his thesis down further, Moas believes that a conservative estimate is that at least 1% of the $200 trillion now tied up in stocks, cash, gold and bonds will migrate into cryptocurrencies over the next decade. \nIn that case, he says, ‘”bitcoin could end up with a market capitalization that is more than Amazon and Apple combined.” \nUnder this scenario, that would mean that the current market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies would naturally grow. \nAnd if Moas’s market capitalization targets are correct, investors would then receive a 1,250% return on their cryptocurrency investments made today. Diversified strategy \nBut he adds one major caveat to that prediction. Simply, “You’ve got to be in the right names.” \nAssuming you accept Moas’s basic bull market thesis for cryptocurrencies, how do you know if you are invested in the right “names” in the cryptocurrency space? And, if the market boom in cryptocurrency is analogous to the roaring years of the 1990s tech boom, how can you avoid investing in the next Pets.com? \nAs Moas frames it: \n“A lot of people say there is a bubble out there. I see a bubble when you get down below the top 50 cryptocurrencies. There are more than 800 names right now. In my view, what happens outside the top 50 is irrelevant.” \nMoas goes on to point out that 91 percent of the nearly $150 billion market cap is invested in the top 20 names and 70 percent is invested in bitcoin and ether alone. \nHe recommends that, for the purposes of portfolio diversification, retail investors should hedge their bets and invest across the top 10 or 20 cryptocurrencies. \nIn Moas’s view, the 800 cryptocurrencies that are now trading are analogous to the 800 stocks that were available on the Nasdaq at the height of the dot-com bubble nearly 20 years ago. While Amazon and Apple and Microsoft emerged to become among the most valuable companies of all time, there were many companies from that time period that died slow and painful deaths. \nOr, as Moas more colorfully puts it: “Back then, there were hundreds of pump-and-dump small-cap junk names just as there are in crypto today. Today, the crypto market is giving you the same signals with names like dash, ripple, litecoin, monero, bitcoin, ethereum , neo, nem, iota and others. “ \nHe went on to add that while there are certainly risks involved in investing in cryptocurrency those risks are, in his view, outweighed by the possibility of 10-to-one or 20-to-one payouts to the upside experienced by tech stocks. The bull case \nOf all the major cryptocurrencies, though, Moas seems especially bullish in his view of bitcoin. Unless there is a major shakeup in the underlying confidence, he believes that investors are going to want to buy-and-hold for their portfolios for 10 years or more. \nMoas points out that there are currently only about 16 million bitcoins that have been issued of a possible total 21 million coins that will be created. \nIn his analysis, this could lead to tens of millions of people trying to get their hands on just a few million coins. \nWhen asked for a specific price target, Moas summed up as follows: \n“At the beginning of July, bitcoin was trading at $2,500. I believe in the next three years you will probably see $15,000 to $20,000 for bitcoin. It could double twice from here in the next 36 months.” \nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Ripple. \nRonnie Moas image via CNBC /Youtube   Interested in offering your expertise or insights to our reporting?

The truth is, with time, the right software, and the strong arm of the law, it’s often possible to put a name to a seemingly-anonymous bitcoin address. IRS Tracking Bitcoin Tax Evaders \nSince 2015, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has been using bitcoin transaction analysis software developed by Chainalysis to “trace the movement of money through the bitcoin economy,” according to contract documents obtained by The Daily Beast. \nThe contract , which was revealed following a Freedom of Information Act request, details the lengths to which the IRS is willing to go to prevent U.S. residents from using cryptocurrency to evade bitcoin tax obligations. \nSpecifically, the IRS has paid Chainalysis more than $88,700 for access to its anti-money laundering software. The company’s “Reactor” software, for instance, is marketed as an “interactive investigative tool” that organizations or law enforcement agencies can use to “track, apprehend, and convict money launderers and cyber criminals.” From the Chainalysis website : \nThrough formal partnerships with Europol and other international law enforcement, our investigative tools have been used globally to successfully track, apprehend, and convict money launderers and cyber criminals. Advertisement: \nWhile blockchain-tracking software such as Reactor does not explicitly reveal the identity of bitcoin address owners, it provides them with a powerful tool to track coins as they move from one wallet to another. Once the coins are transferred to an entity subject to AML/KYC compliance–such as an exchange–law enforcement could obtain and issue a subpoena to the exchange to find out the customer’s identity. \nIn the case of a criminal network, law enforcement would then have clues about the owners of bitcoin addresses that had interacted with those owned by the now-unmasked individual. \nThe revelation that the IRS has been using bitcoin-tracing software since 2015 comes as the agency is embroiled in a legal dispute with Coinbase over whether or not the U.S.-based bitcoin exchange will have to reveal customer identities and other personal information of suspected bitcoin tax cheats. \nAs bitcoin adoption grows–and the bitcoin price continues to progress to record levels–the IRS increasingly wants to make sure U.S. citizens are subject to the “bitcoin tax.” Despite IRS guidance that bitcoin is subject to income and capital gains taxes, the agency claims that only 802 people declared bitcoin profits or losses on their 2015 tax returns. Bitcoin Tracing to Increase Interest in Anonymity-Centric Coins \nUniversity of Surrey computer science professor told the Daily Beast that revelations such as this will likely further encourage the growth of anonymity-centric cryptocurrencies such as Dash, Monero, and Zcash: \nThose who are actively seeking to avoid tax, especially large amounts of tax, will move onto the next cryptocurrency that is not susceptible to the current tracking tools. \nWithin the past week, both the Dash and Monero prices have reached all-time highs . At present, Dash–the 8th-largest coin–is trading at $293 while Monero, ranked 11th is priced at $92, according to CoinMarketCap. \nFeatured image from Shutterstock. ",

    "text": "Marc Barbezat 25 août 2017 La Suisse est-elle une plate-forme de blanchiment pour les hackers? #WannaCry une histoire de $142,000 de rançons Bitcoin On espérait que les histoires de blanchiment d’argent étaient du passé avec la Suisse. Malheureusement, les hackers de WannaCry semblent avoir trouvé une passerelle suisse pour laver leur magot. Plus de 200 000 ordinateurs bloqués en mai Pour rappel, WannaCry a infecté 200 000 ordinateurs en mai, bloquant les systèmes et demandant env. 300 $ en bitcoin aux victimes souhaitant récupérer leurs fichiers. Bien que beaucoup de spécialistes croient que les agresseurs étaient davantage préoccupés à perturber le net plutôt que de rançonner, les auteurs du piratage ont commencé à blanchir les 143 000 $ en bitcoin récupérés. Pour ce faire, ils ont d’abord divisé l’argent dans les trois portefeuilles connus pour être utilisés par WannaCry, avant d’envoyer les fonds à Shapeshift.io pour la conversion en Monero , une monnaie difficile à tracer. En août, aux dernières nouvelles, les pirates n’avaient pas encore déplacé tout l’argent. Seulement 13,5 bitcoins (env. 40 000 $) sur 51,9 avaient alors été déplacés selon les informations recueillies par Forbes dans son article référencé ci-dessous. ShapeShift, le blanchisseur suisse de crypto-monnaie? Forbes rapporte que les pirates de WannaCry ransomware ont changé leur bitcoin en utilisant la plate-forme d’échange ShapeShift localisée en Suisse, dans le canton de Zoug . Sur son site, ShapeShift se décrit de la manière suivante: ShapeShift is a web and API platform formed in August of 2014 to provide instant Bitcoin and altcoin conversion with the maximum level of consumer protection and efficiency. Le site précise également que Users do not have to create accounts, deposit funds, or provide private personal information. This keeps the users safe from identity or financial theft – a critical improvement in exchange technology. Le site ne requiert donc pas d’identification formelle des utilisateurs de la plate-forme. Pas étonnant alors que les pirates de WannaCry aient souhaité profiter de cette anonymité. As of today, we have taken measures to blacklist all addresses associated with the WannaCry attackers that are known to the ShapeShift team, as is our policy for any transactions we deem breach our terms of service. We are closely watching the situation as it continues to unfold as to block any further addresses associated. cryptocoinsnews.com Néanmoins et heureusement comme le rapporte cryptocoinsnews.com, ShapeShift n’a pas l’intention de devenir la plate-forme des cybercriminels et collabore avec les forces de l’ordre. La bonne réaction de l’équipe ShapeShift les préserve de devenir une plate-forme de blanchiment mais les défis restent énormes. La réglementation continue de courir derrière la technologie et ses innovations. Voici encore un florilège d’articles en lien avec cette actualité: WannaCry Hackers Are Using This Swiss Company To Launder $142,000 Bitcoin Ransoms Remember those pesky WannaCry ransomware hackers? They’re starting to shift their bitcoin around and Forbes has learned they’re using a Swiss cryptocurrency exchange called ShapeShift to do it. WannaCry infected as many as 200,000 computers when it broke out in May, locking up systems and demanding $300 in bitcoin from victims wanting their files back. ShapeShift is Assisting Police to Trace Cashed Out Bitcoin From WannaCry Ransomware Get Trading Recommendations and Read Analysis on Hacked.com for just $39 per month. CyberScoopNews journalist Patrick O’Neill revealed on August 3 that ShapeShift, the cryptocurrency market’s most popular instant digital asset exchange, began to assist law enforcement to track bitcoin received and traded by the distributors and developers of the WannaCry ransomware. Bitcoin Exchange ShapeShift Helps Police As WannaCry Attacker Converts To Monero Exchanges ShapeShift and Changelly cooperating with police after it emerged that the WannaCry attackers used it to convert Bitcoin to Monero. As multiple sources report, the fairly modest sums the hackers gained from the international cyberattack have made their way through the two exchanges for the equivalent in Monero (XMR). Digital exchange joins law enforcement in hunt for WannaCry ransom bitcoins Patrick O’Neill, a journalist at CyberScoopNews, has claimed that since August 3rd, ShapeShift has been helping law enforcement to trace bitcoin transactions between WannaCry ransomware distributors and developers. The reason behind ShapeShift’s involvement in the investigation is that Bitcoin withdrawn for the ransomware were exchanged for Monero on this platform. Wannacry money laundering attempt thwarted – BBC News The hackers behind the Wannacry ransomware have tried to conceal who they are by using a virtual currency that is more anonymous than Bitcoin. Victims paid more than $140,000 (£107,000) in bitcoins to recover files scrambled by Wannacry. Earlier this week the gang behind the attack started to move the bitcoins out of the wallets they were paid into. et pour en savoir plus sur ShapeShift:",

    "text": "Browse: Home Mainstream Bitcoin Bitcoin Price Targets $4,400 Despite Dipping Hashrate Bitcoin Price Targets $4,400 Despite Dipping Hashrate   Bitcoin Price Targets $4,400 Despite Dipping Hashrate \nGet Trading Recommendations and Read Analysis on Hacked.com for just $39 per month. \nDespite the hopes of some investors, the market had already priced in SegWit activation, so the bitcoin price remained mostly stable yesterday following the protocol upgrade’s deployment. However, the bitcoin price began to climb on Thursday, and despite a dipping hashrate, it appears bitcoin has $4,400 in its sights. Chart from CoinMarketCap \nBitcoin’s progress, combined with slight bumps to the bitcoin cash and ethereum prices, hoisted the total value of all cryptocurrencies to $155.3 billion, a new all-time high. Chart from CoinMarketCap Bitcoin Price Targets $4,400 \nSince briefly dropping to $3,675 on August 22, the bitcoin price has strung together a three-day advance. That rally continued on Friday, as the bitcoin price rose 4% to $4,360. Bitcoin is now approaching $4,400 and is only $110 from surpassing its current CoinMarketCap record of $4,470. Bitcoin now has a $72 billion market cap. Bitcoin Price Chart from CoinMarketCap \nBitcoin is approaching record levels even as it deals with wild fluctuations in its network hashrate. This network volitility stems from miners moving back and forth from bitcoin to bitcoin cash to mine the most profitable blockchain. Combined BTC and BCH Hashrate | Chart from Fork.lol \nSince the bitcoin cash network has the ability to frequently adjust mining difficulty, mining pools move their hashpower there when it is profitable to mine, and then quickly switch back to bitcoin when BCH difficulty increases. At present, bitcoin cash is about 14% more profitable, which is moving the two hashrates closer to parity. Ethereum Price Inches Past $330 \nThe ethereum price continued its leisurely latter-week climb, rising another 2% to $332. This increased its market cap to $31.3 billion, although its daily trading volume has tapered below $1 billion. Ethereum Price Chart from CoinMarketCap Bitcoin Cash Price Holds Above $660 \nLike ethereum, bitcoin cash volume has plummeted this week, mostly because Korean traders have moved on to other coins, such as Monero and Ripple . However, the bitcoin cash price has demonstrated that it has support above the $600 threshold. That pattern continued on Friday, as the bitcoin cash price recovered from a Thursday evening dip to return a 24-hour gain of 2%. At present, the bitcoin cash price is $665, resulting in a market cap of $11 billion. Bitcoin Cash Price Chart from CoinMarketCap Ripple Price Gets Clobbered \nFew top-tier altcoins saw significant movement on Friday, but there was one major exception. Ripple, the cryptocurrency with the fourth-largest market cap, plunged by 20% after rumors that it would make a major announcement regarding an Asia partnership did not pan out. The ripple price is still significantly higher than it was before this week’s rapid climb, but it has been reduced by nearly one-third since peaking at $0.30 earlier in the week. Altcoin Price Chart from CoinMarketCap \nThe litecoin price also receded, declining 2% after crossing $50 for the first time in August. IOTA and NEM each rose about 4%, maintaining the $40 million distance between their two market caps. NEO and ethereum classic, on the other hand, each declined about 1.5%. \nDash and Monero, the two largest anonymity-centric altcoins, rose 6% and 14%, respectively. Both have seen significant movement this week, which is likely partially-related to the revelation that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service has been using transaction-tracing software since 2015 to unmask bitcoin users they suspect of tax evasion. \nFeatured image from Shutterstock.",
