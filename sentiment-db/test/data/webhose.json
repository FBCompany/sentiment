      "text": "10 Top Cryptocurrency Investors Share Their Favorite Long Term Picks 08/24/2017 09:20 am ET Updated 4 hours ago Licensed from Adobe Stock 730 \nThere’s a lot of focus right now on short-term speculation in the cryptocurrency space. But at some undefined future point, a reversal from speculation to value is going to happen. And when it does, you’ll want to be in the right positions. \nInvesting exclusively in tokens with real world value creation is the philosophy that my crypto hedge fund, General Crypto , is predicated on. Unless you’re a skilled day trader and don’t mind incredible stress levels, it’s wise to buy-and-hold coins with game-changing value rather than just jumping to and from the flavor of the week. \nAnalyzing the validity of that value isn’t easy. So I thought it would be interesting to hear what some very smart people who dedicate themselves full-time to crypto are betting on in the long-term. \nHere are each of their top three picks that they intend to hold (and not decrease position size) for at least the next two years, and why they believe in them so much. \nFood for thought: there is estimated to be around 100 crypto hedge funds currently spinning up in Q3 and Q4 2017. 100! Our fund was featured on Forbes as one of 15. This means a massive on-ramp of institutional capital — the likes of which crypto has never seen before — is about to be opened. And smart money is going to pick the smart cryptos. Here is what myself and nine others think they are going to back. Logan Kugler , Managing Partner at General Crypto \nI’ll start with my three favorite. \nRIPPLE ( XRP ) — Ripple is going after SWIFT, and their token XRP could entirely change the way we send money internationally. Why? Currently money takes days to move internationally, and the fees are enormous. There’s literally no way today to send money from one country to another same-day, other than by boarding a plane with a suitcase full of cash. XRP can transfer value (read: money) anywhere in the world in four seconds, at a cost of pennies . And unlike other coins, it doesn’t get bogged down when hit by huge volume. \nWhy am I bullish? The market size is as big as it gets (SWIFT moves $5 trillion USD per day ), the technology is already built (Ripple has been working on it since 2012), their team is world-class, and nearly 100 banking partnerships are already in place with pilots running or about to start. The CEO of SBI Holdings believes XRP will become the global standard in digital currencies. \nBitcoin maximalists like saying that XRP is not a true crypto because it’s not decentralized. The reality is Ripple is working towards making XRP even more decentralized than Bitcoin. It could take a while, but they’re already off to a good start . \nWhat some people miss about XRP is the timeline. Ripple stands to revolutionize the entire banking industry. That’s not going to happen overnight. It will have its rallies and its steep corrections, but I expect it to consistently go up. Don’t buy this one expecting big things to happen as fast as other coins. (And don’t get cold feet when it drops half.) The key difference is that XRP is predicated on an extremely strong use case, team, and technology. Be willing to buy now and hold this token for minimally the next five years and I think you’ll see an incredible return on investment. If you want a simple way to think about Ripple: XRP is going to let us move money across borders in the same way that we move information across them today. And that’s an astronomical upside. \nHere’s a long article I wrote about XRP if you’re interested in knowing more. \nPrice when this published: $0.266 \nFACTOM ( FCT ) — Factom offers the promise of immutable records. This could be huge for the (trillion-dollar) mortgage industry , banks and audit records, retail with huge databases like Target, studios with enormous catalogs of movies like Warner Bros., and governments for historical documents. Factom’s competitions are currently bounded by only proving the positive (e.g. “can we show X has existed in the chain?”), which would pertain to proof of existence, integrity, ownership, etc. — which is limited for the overall problem they are trying to solve. Factom can prove both the positive and the negative and see if a piece of information didn’t exist at a certain period in time, or whether it’s the latest version. Factom could change how major record keepers keep records and ensure eternal existence of all records. \nPrice when this published: $25.61 \nMONERO ( XMR ) — One of the original promises of Bitcoin was anonymity. It turns out it’s not quite as anonymous as a lot of people initially think. While who owns a particular wallet address is unknown, the transactions can be easily followed. So if your identity gets associated with a wallet address, some analysis can essentially turn your transactions into public bank statements. Enter anonymous coins (or “anon coins”), of which XMR is leading the field in privacy. It scrambles your address automatically each time, so you don’t have to worry about leaving a trail. I can see Monero XMR becoming very popular among those seeking anonymous transactions. What’s still up in the air is whether or not it can scale. Within hours of writing, XMR experienced a 50% price surge, which saw vastly extended transaction times. \nPrice when this published: $83.59 Spencer Bogart , Managing Director and Head of Research at Blockchain Capital \nBITCOIN ( BTC ) — Bitcoin has proven its ability to efficiently serve a few use cases that represent giant market opportunities. Amazon first proved it could efficiently sell things online and it focused on this ability before growing into other opportunities. I think the same will be true of Bitcoin. \nPrice when this published: $4,180 \nMONERO ( XMR ) — If I were forced to pick one thing that I was most concerned about for Bitcoin, it would be a lack of privacy. Each Bitcoin should be worth as much as any other Bitcoin, regardless of who owned it before you or what they did with it. For now, this isn’t a big problem. But Monero is a good hedge against this risk, since it’s more private than Bitcoin and therefore doesn’t have the same degree of fungibility risk. \nLITECOIN ( LTC ) — Silver to Bitcoin’s gold. The code is so similar to Bitcoin that Litecoin is able to leverage Bitcoin’s developer network and improvements. This is a big advantage over other coins that try to build a developer community from the ground up. If anything catastrophic happened to Bitcoin, a decent portion of the capital would likely flow to Litecoin. \nPrice when this published: $51.63 Rafe Furst , Chief Investment Officer at The Crypto Company \nDASH ( DASH ) — Bitcoin’s reign as the gateway cryptocurrency is coming to an end. The question is, what will replace it? Arguments can be made for Litecoin, Zcash, Ripple, or Monero. I like Dash because of its focus on consumer-friendliness and its flexible, decentralized governance protocol. For example, it took just 24 hours for the Dash community to approve a proposed blocksize increase back in 2016, while the Bitcoin community took three years to address its scalability problems, and the debate ended in a hard fork. \nPrice when this published: $296.56 \nETHEREUM ( ETH ) — While Ethereum won’t replace the function of Bitcoin, it will continue to play the important role it currently does as a smart-contract engine, and as a master blockchain to spawn new application tokens. \nPrice when this published: $324.99 \nSTEEM ( STEEM ) — Imagine if your social media posts could earn you money based on how popular they were. Imagine if you could get paid as tastemaker and curator of content published by others. Now what if the content creators kept 100% of the ownership rights to their content, and there were no advertisers or special interests getting between creators and fans? Steem is the first utility token that is truly being used for this function. Platforms like Reddit, Medium, and even Facebook should be nervous. \nPrice when this published: $1.25 Brad Mills , Fund Strategist at Alphabit \nBITCOIN ( BTC ) — I’ve been holding Bitcoin since 2011 when I started mining in my basement, and I will keep holding until it’s at least $100,000 per coin, which I expect in three to five years. Fundamentally strong, this is the original blockchain that is and was designed to be money. \nI get excited when I see Bitcoin becoming legal tender in countries like Japan, South Korea, and India. It's only a matter of time before a Bitcoin ETF is approved, and we see sovereign wealth and endowment funds allocating money into Bitcoin as a new asset class. \nMETAL ( MTL ) — Metal is one of Alphabit’s core positions that we will be holding long-term. Currently, it sits at only a $190 million market cap, which we think could grow to $1 billion or greater over the next year. Metal has the dual-use case of being not only a crypto-rewards token and peer-to-peer payments app like Venmo, but also an FDIC-insured fiat on-ramp bank in your pocket for the average person to make it easy to use cryptocurrency. For a competitor in market cap, I look at Dash which is currently at $2.3 billion, and also focusing on mass user adoption. \nPrice when this published: $8.78 \nWAVES ( WAVES ) — Waves is Russia's largest blockchain project. At it's core, it's a decentralized exchange and user-created token fundraising platform, forked from the NXT codebase. An ICO was held in 2016 that raised $16 million, which has grown to a market cap of over $300 million. \nThis month, a partnership was announced between Gazprombank and Waves. The partnership focuses on holding ICOs for Russian mining and metals companies, bringing a lot of legitimacy to the platform. \nPrice when this published: $4.64 CryptoYoda , well-respected cryptocurrency trader on Twitter \nLITECOIN ( LTC ) — It’s the second oldest and most trusted blockchain to date, and in addition to being about four times faster than Bitcoin, it has successfully managed to activate Segwit well before any blocksize debate, which to me is a sign of positive adaptability. For being a fork of Bitcoin with only minor differences in algorithm, trading at about 1.5% of Bitcoin's value is utterly insane, given it’s a more convenient payment coin. Bitcoin will primarily be a store-of-value, just as silver versus gold. \nETHEREUM CLASSIC ( ETC ) — The reason ETC’s price is so low compared to Ethereum (ETH) is the confusion about what happened during the hardfork a year ago. In July 2016, the community decided to hard fork the Ethereum blockchain in order to restore lost funds of DAO investors by rolling back the blockchain to a point in time before the hack. \nThere was huge resistance in the Ethereum community because of their devotion to the immutability of blockchains. Part of the community decided to violate that “law” to bail out those affected by the DAO hack, creating ETH. ETC is currently trading at 14.3% of ETH's value, which is a severe undervaluation in my eyes, given it's loyalty towards the core principle of cryptocurrency. \nPrice when this published: $15.51 \nZCASH ( ZEC ) — There are many undervalued coins offering anonymity to users, with Zcash and Monero being the most prominent. I think Zcash is positioned to be one of the biggest winners. It has huge interest, is elaborately designed, and has a high-security creation process and very limited supply. Its lack of recent price advancement indicates to me that traders are accumulating it. \nPrice when this published: $231.04 Romano , well-respected cryptocurrency trader on Twitter; also the lead developer of Viacoin (VIA) \nSTRATIS ( STRAT ) — Stratis makes blockchain easy for enterprise. They offer simple and affordable end-to-end solutions for development, testing and deployment of native C# blockchain applications. Ever see an article that talks about a bank starting to use blockchain technology? They don't use the Bitcoin blockchain, but a private chain like Stratis. Stratis makes it easier than ever before for organizations to deploy private blockchains. They’re in talks with many huge companies like Microsoft, Jaguar, Reuters, Cashaa, AIA Group, RBC Capital Markets, Deutsche Bank, etc. \nPrice when this published: $6.09 \nDECRED ( DCR ) — Decred will soon get the Lightening Network. Which means you can send small transactions for almost no fee, instantly. The Lightening Network is a big thing which many underestimate. Notable about Decred is that they’ve learned and implemented a lot from the success of Dash. But whereas Dash has a lot of outside funding (and is accountable to investors), Decred is self-funded via block subsidy (accountable only to its users) and they are entirely transparent about the allocations. Decred has decentralized voting, Charlie Lee (Litecoin’s lead developer) on their team, and their code looks clean and is beautifully written. \nPrice when this published: $29.97 \nZCOIN ( XZC ) — While a lot of other anonymous coins bill themselves as completely anonymous, they are not, as this video explains . This is also a great article explaining why most anon coins aren’t actually completely anonymous. Only ZCoin is completely anonymous and I think at some point the market will recognize that and it will be in the same league market cap wise as Monero. Right now, ZCoin looks very undervalued to me as their market cap is only $26 million (compared to Monero’s $1.2 billion). Also worth noting: Roger Ver has said good things about ZCoin (and I don't like Roger Ver at all, but he has very deep pockets). \nPrice when this published: $9.55 CryptoVisionary , founder of the Phoenix Trading Group \nRIPPLE ( XRP ) — Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), the technology that powers Ripple and its associated coin XRP, allows anyone anywhere in the world to transact money in the same way as sending data (at fractions of the cost). For markets such as international remittance, this means monumental change is underway. ($500 billion is transacted yearly in the remittance sector.) Many of the largest banks in the world (more than 100) have plans to leverage DLT and Ripple to cut costs for their payment servicing. In fact, even the Federal Reserve and the Central Bank of England are testing out Ripple for real-time payment capabilities. \nAUGUR ( REP ) — Businesses around the world pay a high premium for actionable intelligence for their own internal and strategic needs. With Augur, anyone in the world can obtain information on the probability of a future event. Think of it as the Google search for future events, peering into the future using a fascinating principle known as wisdom of the crowd. Such a technology could drastically impact many industries, including trillion-dollar or larger industries like gambling and sports betting. \nPrice when this published: $22.59 \nQTUM ( QTUM ) — Think of Qtum like an Ethereum for China, except that it's a Proof of Stake coin. It’s a more environmentally friendly way to secure the network, with a drastic reduction in the consumption of electricity compared to Proof of Work systems like Bitcoin. Like Ethereum, Qtum will host a number of applications developed by independent third parties, has an all-star cast in terms of advisors (one of their co-founders was recently cited in Forbes China’s “30 Under 30” list.) \nPrice when this published: $13.49 notsofast , well-respected cryptocurrency trader on Twitter \nBLOCKNET ( BLOCK ) — Of all projects competing to release a decentralized, native cryptocurrency exchange, Blocknet's technology is far and away the strongest, easiest to implement, and closest to market. \nBlocknet removes the third-party risk in sending your coins to trade on an exchange. You can collateralize 5,000 blocknet in a service node, run any wallets you want on the same machine as that node, and earn BLOCK in trade fees whenever someone trades a currency your node supports. The blocknet protocol will fundamentally advance the use of blockchains the way IE or Netscape standardized and unlocked the World Wide Web. \nPrice when this published: $14.12 \nUBIQ ( UBQ ) — The DAO philosophical failure and Ethereum network split opened the door to competitors on smart contract blockchains. Ubiq is the strongest: immutable unlike ETH, and with a brand focus away from experimentation and toward corporate professionalism. Once the Ethereum ICO craze breaks and that platform loses trust, Ubiq's secure network and failure-free track record will present it as a viable smart contract competitor. \nPrice when this published: $1.55 \nPARKBYTE ( PKB ) (Soon to be ParkChain; PKC) — Parkbyte is my appcoin bet. It's a simple premise to disrupt a ubiquitous and unsexy industry with better tracking, standardized UX, and lower costs and efficiency throughout. Via industry experience, the developers acutely understands exactly what needs to be pitched to whom in order to disrupt existing pay-to-park systems with a blockchain implementation. \nPrice when this published: $0.278 Squeeze , well-respected cryptocurrency trader on Twitter \nCIVIC ( CVC ) — Civic is a secure identity platform that uses the Civic tokens for identification purposes. Vinny Lingham is the CEO of Civic and he's one of the \"Sharks\" on Shark Tank South Africa. Civic has both the concept and the team. With Vinny's connections and influence, many sites have already integrated Civic. For this type of identity verification, user adoption is very important. Without adoption, there's no use case. \nPrice when this published: $0.546 \nTEZOS (TEZ) — By far, the biggest ICO funding, with $230 million. It has huge names backing it like billionaire Tim Draper. Their algorithm runs on a delegated proof of stake system. It is also capable of anonymous transactions which utilizes the Zcash's proof circuit on a side token. They have plans to replace this process with a better option in the future. It is also possible to create applications on Tezos similar to Ethereum. I have no doubt that it will hit a multibillion market cap in a year. \nPrice when this published: (not publicly traded yet) \nLISK ( LSK ) — This is one of the underdogs that a lot of people missed. It's currently at $233 million market cap. Lisk (similar to Tezos) is utilizing the Delegated Proof of Stake system, where \"delegates\" verify the transactions and have voting capabilities that steer the direction of Lisk. \nThe main development plan this year is to create an SDK for developing and deploying blockchain applications (smart contracts). They have a strong development team and they have sufficient funds ($62 million) to keep it going for tens of years. \nPrice when this published: $3.42 sicarious , well-respected cryptocurrency trader on Twitter \nDECRED ( DCR ) — Decred is perhaps the most innovative Proof of Stake coin on the market today, and boasts an impressive (and production ready) decentralized governance system. In addition to governance solutions, Decred is preparing to throw their hat into the ring of anonymous transactions later this year. The Bitcoin scaling debate and increasing government scrutiny of the cryptocurrency ecosystem emphasize the importance of both governance and anonymity, setting the stage for Decred’s growth through the end of 2017 and 2018. \nUBIQ ( UBQ ) — Ubiq has an upgraded codebase, newly-designed difficulty algorithm, monetary policy, and several million-dollar projects running as tokens on its chain. Additionally, it was launched in a spirit of fairness with zero ICO or developer premine. Currently valued at less than 0.5% of ETH’s market cap, Ubiq provides a top-tier alternative to ETH at a dramatically cheaper rate. \nBASIC ATTENTION TOKEN ( BAT ) — The free and open internet as we know it runs on advertisements, and yet adblockers are seeing increasing adoption among internet users. BAT seeks to solve this problem by creating a mutually beneficial common ground between advertisers and users, centered around their internet browser, Brave. \nPrice when this published: $0.200 Licensed from Adobe Stock \nNotice: None of the information contained in this article is investment advice.

Today the Malta-headquartered company launched a dedicated altcoin index, XAI, which reflects the dynamics of the altcoin world (all cryptocurrencies minus Bitcoin). The XAI-Fund, which is available to EXANTE clients immediately, follows the index, to profit from the rise in prices of most altcoins in an easy safe and regulated way. The XAI index is made up of nearly all available popular alternative cryptocurrencies. Anatoliy Knyazev, co-founder of EXANTE elaborated: 'Just a couple of weeks ago we launched separate funds for Ripple, Ethereum. Monero, Zcash and Litecoin - which was a huge success. We did notice an additional demand from clients who don't have the time or the technological means to deep-dive and analyze each currency separately - but do want to profit from the bullish altcoin markets. XAI is the solution to that problem.' EXANTE clients can trade XAI fund shares are regular exchange traded instruments and they are accessible via the general trading platform. This platform gives traders direct access to more than 50 thousand financial products and nearly all financial markets. Trading in these products, is regulated by the MFSA and audited by KPMG, adding a layer of security normally missing from the unregulated cryptocurrency market. Besides the aforementioned altcoins, the XAI-index also tracks Ethereum Classic. 'We decided to leave out Bitcoin,' said Knyazev, 'since it has less fat left on its bone. Ripple and Monero, for example, nearly doubled in value recently. That's what makes investing in the XAI fund so interesting and exciting.' -END-",

      "text": "Business and Finance daily market ltc NEWS Prediction No Comments \nIn the previous writing related to Litecoin Price development, we mentioned for further gains, a breakout over the $50 is required which even happened in the last 24 hours. The Digital currency was spiking in increase aiming to reach and set a new all-time high record but the catapulting stopped at $54.78. However in the positive note, it had stable ground and hovered over the $50 trending line. \nThe 24 hour trading volume for Litecoin is $619.6, only behind of Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple – Based on CoinmarketCap. Even like in other cases like Monero , ETC , Ripple that last days South Korean trading/exchanging platforms leading with 20.4% leaving behind Chinese ones like OkCoin and Huobi. \nSource Coinmarketcap \nExcept that in general the market relating to different cryptocurrencies has been spiking there is no specific reason for Litecoin surge yesterday. Only adding that the team is working in several significant features to be installed in the platform. The Litecoin community is eagerly anticipating the inclusion of cross-chain atomic swaps between LTC and BTC in the near future. On top of that implementing its own version of the Lightening Network, could dramatically increase transaction speeds. \nMovements like the first to adopt Segregated Witness on the scaling upgrade, have shown how Charile Lee the creator wants to improve the heavily-influenced by the original platform Litecoin. LTC is often even even called “The Silver side of Gold Bitcoin” reflecting how much they are similar. Maybe the community positive energy that results of the hard work for improvement is keeping the digital currency upwards. \nTrading today – the Litecoin price stood at $51.10, as of 15:51 BST. The cryptocurrency has gained 5.10% over the past 24 hours, according to Coinmarketcap. \nRead Also: ",

      "text": "16 Views \nMalta-based brokerage company EXANTE has launched a fund based on altcoin index. We have just launched the first investment fund based on a #cryptocurrency index. Meet https://t.co/osLH8Dk85k, exclusive at #EXANTE Sponsored Links \n— EXANTE (@EXANTE_EU) 24 August 2017 \nUnderlying the XAI.Fund is XNT Altcoin Index (XAI). Currently it supports six main altcoins: Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Ripple, Monero, Litecoin, and ZCash. The company explained this choice by the fact that said altcoins account for 30% of the entire market. \n“We intentionally did not include Bitcoin in the index: thus, our market cap weighted index became even more promising,” the company’s statement reads. \nInitially, management of those assets will be available via a personal manager, yet the company intends to bring the option to their trading platform as well. The fee will comprise 0.5% of the transaction’s amount, with the minimal lot being 0.001 of the index as expressed in USD. EXANTE noted that the fund features safe storage of assets and management via a brokerage account. \n“Besides, with XAI.Fund corporate clients now have a capability to legally invest into cryptocurrencies without experiencing problems with accounting or taxation,” the statement goes on. \nThe cryptocurrencies listed above have been added to EXANTE this June for the purpose of standard trading at the same account and platform used for shares, ETF, derivatives and other financial instruments. \nAnatoliy Knyazev, co-founder of EXANTE elaborated: \n“Just a couple of weeks ago we launched separate funds for Ripple, Ethereum. Monero, Zcash and Litecoin – which was a huge success. We did notice an additional demand from clients who don’t have the time or the technological means to deep-dive and analyze each currency separately – but do want to profit from the bullish altcoin markets. XAI is the solution to that problem.”",

      "text": "Fintech VC @ Illuminate Financial Based In London Aug 16 So, you want to start or invest in a Blockchain crypto fund? Part I/II This post reflects only my personal views on the current crypto fund market. Like anyone working in Fintech VC, I have been trying to make sense of the recent crypto craze. The first part highlights the different challenges around pre-trade, execution and post-trade, and is designed for all my banker / Hedge Fund friends who think they can apply their skill set to crypto. The second part will highlight my view on the current crypto fund landscape. I may be wrong, but thought it would be great to share this and to gather feedback. PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS. Also, I am very happy to have a chat or share notes, just email me at ebrunet40@gmail.com The total crypto market cap reached $132BN , Filecoin ICO raised $200m in 60mn and c rypto helped Nvidia beat its own guidance for the most recent quarter . Even CNBC Africa launched a new program called Crypto Trader . What happened over the last few months? I have no idea if we are in a bubble but lots of money is going into the crypto space; companies who could not raise VC money and sometimes without a working product are launching Initial Coin Offering (ICO) and even the SEC has released an investor bulletin about ICO including some key points to consider when determining whether to participate in an ICO . I guess the market is hot . Even coinmarketcap has more reads than the WSJ. Coinmarketcap is now ranked higher than WSJ on Alexa. Go crypto! Last spring saw a surge in the price of the Bitcoin and Ethereum, driven by geopolitical and economic reasons including, among others, Trump’s presidency, rising debt levels and new crypto friendly regulations in China and Japan . The price increase led many early Bitcoin and Ether investors to suddenly have a large war chest composed of mainly Bitcoin and Ether, worth from a few hundreds to a few millions of dollars. Most of the early adopters decided to embrace a classic early stage investment strategy named “Spray and Pray”, investing in as many ICOs as possible in order to gain exposure to at least a few successful ones which would return their total investment. Such a strategy does not require investors to perform in depth due diligence (which is good because it is really hard to assess a pre-product, pre-team and sometimes pre-whitepaper company). Here it is a numbers game. For this reason, many companies who struggled in the past to raise VC funding turned to ICO as they could easily raise a few millions dollars. Source: https://mgstover.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/HFA_071217_DigitalCurrency-1.pdf At the same time, the mainstream public started to hear about stories of people becoming millionaires by investing in crypto ( some even wrote a book ) and companies raising millions with only a website and whitepaper written in LaTex . The influx of Retail investors and HNWIs wanting not to miss their chance to become a UHNWI has pushed the total crypto total market cap to a new high. Results? $1.7bn and counting raised from ICOs and a $130bn+ Crypto market cap. Crap. I should have listened to my Bitcoin enthusiast cousin in 2013. So what’s next? Well some people see an opportunity as classic institutional investors are not yet equipped to invest in crypto currencies. At the same time, HNWI, family offices, private banks and others are looking to gain exposure to this new asset class. Just in case… you know... it becomes huge. Hence, anyone wishing to be in the crypto space has two options. Either start their own crypto fund, or start a company and do an ICO as soon as possible. The rest of the post will cover the first option, crypto funds. 1- Pre-Trade. Execution. Post-Trade. Regulation. This is for all my banker and PE/VCs friends who think it is easy to setup a crypto fund. It is not. 2- Crypto fund Landscape. For anyone interested in learning more who is in and who is not. [To be published end of August 2017] Enjoy. Pre-Trade. Execution. Post-Trade. Regulation. Say What? As TwoBitIdiot highlights in his post Losing Alpha: Why Most New Crypto Funds Are a Sh*t Deal , it is fairly easy to see the main arguments that crypto hedge fund wannabes use in their pitch. The crypto market is large and growing extremely quickly, but not without regulation, compliance and custody processes. As the market is not yet fully regulated anyone can use insider information (not sure I would recommend that one, though). Howeover, as the crypto market remains opaque for most people, there is an opportunity for savvy Bitcointalk readers to monetise their knowledge. Pre-Trade: Goodbye Bloomberg. Hello Reddit. Pre-trade refers broadly describes the analysis leading to the selection of a specific token / crypto currencies. First you need to build an investment thesis. For example, MetaStable is investing into digital currencies like Bitcoin, Monero etc. Not ICO / Token per se. They have written an awesome blog posts about it. Great, you have a thesis. Good for you. Next step, how do you select companies / currencies / tokens? Here you don’t have Bloomberg, no investor relation page (yet), only a few sell-side research house (The Goldman Sachs of crypto: Smith+Crown ). One needs to gather intel from slack channels (e.g. Coinfund ), listen to specialised podcasts (E.g. EpiCenter ), follow niche news websites (e.g. Coindesk ), read on forum like Reddit . Once you have done that you need to build relationships with the team. For example have you been to the last Token Summit or Devcon2? Let’s say you have a team of research analysts with a good understanding of the Blockchain. You nailed it. Great, but do you have data scientists with blockchain background? That is hard to find. Even Polychain is looking for one . Imagine you find one. He / She would need to build connectivity with different exchanges to gather historical / live data (or use Kaiko or Coinigy ) to be able to perform quantitative analysis. In addition, to quant and fundamental research analysts you also need to have people with deep cryptography expertise. Finding talents who understand what is an ERC20 token and what impact the Plasma project may have on Ethereum is not easy. Even less easy when people with such knowledge could most likely do an ICO and raise millions. Execution. I still miss Bloomberg. Where is my broker? Execution differs if you are investing pre-ICO or post-ICO. The first is quite straight forward. A company asks you to transfer either BTC, ETH or LTC to a certain address and in exchange you will receive a certain number of tokens post-ICO. Recent ICOs use Coinlist to make things even easier and regulated. They often happen with a discount of 10 to 80%. This is great but you need to have access to these deals. As TwoBitIdiot explained, the Polychain and BlueYard Capital of the world will be in this deal. Not you. Game over. How about Post-ICO? Here you need to build relationships and order flow connectivity with as many exchanges as you can. I would say at least 15. Ari Paul from Blocktower has 20+ . In addition, you need to find a reliable OTC broker. There are only a handful in the world that are recognised and legit like Genesis Trading from DCG . Note, even with strong relationships there is no insurance that you can get access to liquidity to buy / sell your tokens. It is different when you want to sell $2m than when you sell $20k. Moreover, there is always a counter party risk when you do business with a private exchange / OTC broker… Some other questions to keep in mind: What is your risk management? How do you deal with pumps and dumps? Are there good enough measures of VaR etc. for those markets? Very different than investing in private securities, right? Or when you bought Apple shares on Charles Schwab , right? Post-trade. Where is my custodian? Cold or hot wallet? You bought your Bitcoin or other coins / tokens. What do you do with it? JPMorgan Chase does not provide token custody. Would you let $10m+ worth of coins sit in your ledger wallet ? What is an air-gapped compute r and is it really safe ( apparently not )? Do you store your coins at your offices? Do you use Xapo as a custodian? What if you need to do a “quick” trade and you need to have some coins stored on exchanges? Is that ok? Regulation. The major systemic risk. The recent judgement on the DAO cas e was not a surprise for anyone involved in the crypto land. What was surprising was the detailed level of understanding of the SEC. Read the DAO report of investigation . It is super well written and comprehensive. From my view the main takeaway is that the SEC understands the ICO market quite well and there is a high chance that new regulations will come in the next 12 months. Some exchanges may have to stop trading certain tokens and will need to perform serious KYC checks. A good example is the recent news from Bitfinex ( Suspension of U.S. Individual Verification Requests and Bitfinex will be barring U.S. customers from trading ERC20 tokens issued through “ICOs ). You get the point. Pre-trade, Execution and Post-trade is not straightforward. It is not rocket science but you need proper resources, an acute awareness of the evolving regulatory situation and of course, some blockchain knowledge. Summary of the questions for each stage that one needs to think about for their crypto fund. If you like my post don’t forget to forward it, recommend it, add comments and share it with your friends.

The crypto currency wallet has to be treated as your primary email account in terms of security. Bitcoins and ethereum blockchain is so big that creating a local wallet and recovering in case of a system crash is big headache. We have many other cryptocurrencies that can be exchanged with bitcoins. Monero coins are now trending higher. I personally prefer AEON coin as its price is less at present and has potential to move like monero. Creating a local wallet and syncing is faster that monero. Transaction fee and confirmation time is also less.",

      "text": "EXANTE, the European fintech firm that made history in 2012 by launching the world's first Bitcoin hedge fund, is once again shaking up the investment industry. Today the Malta-headquartered company launched a dedicated altcoin index, XAI, which reflects the dynamics of the altcoin world (all cryptocurrencies minus Bitcoin). The XAI-Fund, which is available to EXANTE clients immediately, follows the index, to profit from the rise in prices of most altcoins in an easy safe and regulated way. The XAI index is made up of nearly all available popular alternative cryptocurrencies.\n\nAnatoliy Knyazev, co-founder of EXANTE elaborated: 'Just a couple of weeks ago we launched separate funds for Ripple, Ethereum. Monero, Zcash and Litecoin - which was a huge success. We did notice an additional demand from clients who don't have the time or the technological means to deep-dive and analyze each currency separately - but do want to profit from the bullish altcoin markets. XAI is the solution to that problem.'\n\nEXANTE clients can trade XAI fund shares are regular exchange traded instruments and they are accessible via the general trading platform. This platform gives traders direct access to more than 50 thousand financial products and nearly all financial markets. Trading in these products, is regulated by the MFSA and audited by KPMG, adding a layer of security normally missing from the unregulated cryptocurrency market.\n\nBesides the aforementioned altcoins, the XAI-index also tracks Ethereum Classic. 'We decided to leave out Bitcoin,' said Knyazev, 'since it has less fat left on its bone. Ripple and Monero, for example, nearly doubled in value recently. That's what makes investing in the XAI fund so interesting and exciting.'\n\n*-END-*\n\n*For further information contact:*\nThijs Plug\nHead of Content\nT: +356 2015 0000\nE: plug@exante.eu\n\n*Note to editors*\n\nAbout EXANTE:\nEXANTE is a European investment company established in 2011.

      "text": "Browse: Home Mainstream Bitcoin Standpoint Founder: Bitcoin Asset Class Will Grow Into $2 Trillion Market Standpoint Founder: Bitcoin Asset Class Will Grow Into $2 Trillion Market   Standpoint Founder: Bitcoin Asset Class Will Grow Into $2 Trillion Market \nForget $5,000. \nAt a time when many are making short-term bets on the price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, one bitcoin bull is going a step further. Ronnie Moas, founder of Standpoint Research, is making the case cryptocurrencies will not only be a decade-long trend, but a viable asset class. \nIn fact, he’s going so far as to call for a massive rise in the market cap of cryptocurrencies. His prediction? The total value of all cryptographic assets, today valued at $150 billion , will soar to $2 trillion over the next 10 years. \nAnd in a new interview, Moas walked CoinDesk through his forecast, explaining how it stems from his fundamental analysis of the capital markets and the broader macroeconomic trends he now sees in place. \nThe Standpoint founder’s view stands in stark contrast to the highly bearish analysis of Peter Schiff, who called cryptocurrency a bubble, a speculative frenzy and a natural Ponzi scheme driven by “just plain greed” last week. \nIn the broadest sense, Moas sees the current state of the cryptocurrency market as a direct parallel to Silicon Valley during the 1990s, when a massive surge of innovation created new technologies that transformed the way we work and live and ushered in a period of massive wealth creation. \nHe explained: \n“I am not any more concerned with bitcoin being at a record high than Amazon or Google investors were concerned when those share prices jumped hundreds of percent and hit $100 and $200 many years ago. Today, both of those stocks are above $900. The question is not where we are at – it is where are we going? I do not think we are in a bubble.” Roadmap to $2 trillion \nHow does Moas get to the $2 trillion market cap for cryptocurrency in his forecast? \nHe begins by looking at the $200 trillion that is currently invested in the global capital markets today, including all major asset classes: cash, stocks, bonds and gold. Moas, who also does traditional equity analysis, begins his market breakdown with stocks, which he believes are currently overvalued. \nAccording to Moas, three-quarters of the names in the S&P 500 are trading at least 18 times earnings, which is higher than his value threshold of 12 times earnings. He also adds that we haven’t had a stock market correction in 20 months. \nOn the currency front, the U.S. dollar is currently losing 1–2 percent per year due to inflation. Moas also points out that the dollar has lost half its value since he was in high school 35 years ago. \nFrom a global perspective, where most people don’t have access to U.S. dollars, Moas believes the case for cryptocurrency is even more compelling: \n“Now, imagine what they think of their own local currencies elsewhere in the world. Imagine you live in Venezuela and you’re keeping your money under the mattress. Would you rather leave it there in Venezuelan bolivar or would you rather put it in bitcoin? It’s not going to take you very long to make that decision.” \nBreaking his thesis down further, Moas believes that a conservative estimate is that at least 1% of the $200 trillion now tied up in stocks, cash, gold and bonds will migrate into cryptocurrencies over the next decade. \nIn that case, he says, ‘”bitcoin could end up with a market capitalization that is more than Amazon and Apple combined.” \nUnder this scenario, that would mean that the current market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies would naturally grow. \nAnd if Moas’s market capitalization targets are correct, investors would then receive a 1,250% return on their cryptocurrency investments made today. Diversified strategy \nBut he adds one major caveat to that prediction. Simply, “You’ve got to be in the right names.” \nAssuming you accept Moas’s basic bull market thesis for cryptocurrencies, how do you know if you are invested in the right “names” in the cryptocurrency space? And, if the market boom in cryptocurrency is analogous to the roaring years of the 1990s tech boom, how can you avoid investing in the next Pets.com? \nAs Moas frames it: \n“A lot of people say there is a bubble out there. I see a bubble when you get down below the top 50 cryptocurrencies. There are more than 800 names right now. In my view, what happens outside the top 50 is irrelevant.” \nMoas goes on to point out that 91 percent of the nearly $150 billion market cap is invested in the top 20 names and 70 percent is invested in bitcoin and ether alone. \nHe recommends that, for the purposes of portfolio diversification, retail investors should hedge their bets and invest across the top 10 or 20 cryptocurrencies. \nIn Moas’s view, the 800 cryptocurrencies that are now trading are analogous to the 800 stocks that were available on the Nasdaq at the height of the dot-com bubble nearly 20 years ago. While Amazon and Apple and Microsoft emerged to become among the most valuable companies of all time, there were many companies from that time period that died slow and painful deaths. \nOr, as Moas more colorfully puts it: “Back then, there were hundreds of pump-and-dump small-cap junk names just as there are in crypto today. Today, the crypto market is giving you the same signals with names like dash, ripple, litecoin, monero, bitcoin, ethereum , neo, nem, iota and others. “ \nHe went on to add that while there are certainly risks involved in investing in cryptocurrency those risks are, in his view, outweighed by the possibility of 10-to-one or 20-to-one payouts to the upside experienced by tech stocks. The bull case \nOf all the major cryptocurrencies, though, Moas seems especially bullish in his view of bitcoin. Unless there is a major shakeup in the underlying confidence, he believes that investors are going to want to buy-and-hold for their portfolios for 10 years or more. \nMoas points out that there are currently only about 16 million bitcoins that have been issued of a possible total 21 million coins that will be created. \nIn his analysis, this could lead to tens of millions of people trying to get their hands on just a few million coins. \nWhen asked for a specific price target, Moas summed up as follows: \n“At the beginning of July, bitcoin was trading at $2,500. I believe in the next three years you will probably see $15,000 to $20,000 for bitcoin. It could double twice from here in the next 36 months.” \nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Ripple. \nRonnie Moas image via CNBC /Youtube   Interested in offering your expertise or insights to our reporting?

The truth is, with time, the right software, and the strong arm of the law, it’s often possible to put a name to a seemingly-anonymous bitcoin address. IRS Tracking Bitcoin Tax Evaders \nSince 2015, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has been using bitcoin transaction analysis software developed by Chainalysis to “trace the movement of money through the bitcoin economy,” according to contract documents obtained by The Daily Beast. \nThe contract , which was revealed following a Freedom of Information Act request, details the lengths to which the IRS is willing to go to prevent U.S. residents from using cryptocurrency to evade bitcoin tax obligations. \nSpecifically, the IRS has paid Chainalysis more than $88,700 for access to its anti-money laundering software. The company’s “Reactor” software, for instance, is marketed as an “interactive investigative tool” that organizations or law enforcement agencies can use to “track, apprehend, and convict money launderers and cyber criminals.” From the Chainalysis website : \nThrough formal partnerships with Europol and other international law enforcement, our investigative tools have been used globally to successfully track, apprehend, and convict money launderers and cyber criminals. Advertisement: \nWhile blockchain-tracking software such as Reactor does not explicitly reveal the identity of bitcoin address owners, it provides them with a powerful tool to track coins as they move from one wallet to another. Once the coins are transferred to an entity subject to AML/KYC compliance–such as an exchange–law enforcement could obtain and issue a subpoena to the exchange to find out the customer’s identity. \nIn the case of a criminal network, law enforcement would then have clues about the owners of bitcoin addresses that had interacted with those owned by the now-unmasked individual. \nThe revelation that the IRS has been using bitcoin-tracing software since 2015 comes as the agency is embroiled in a legal dispute with Coinbase over whether or not the U.S.-based bitcoin exchange will have to reveal customer identities and other personal information of suspected bitcoin tax cheats. \nAs bitcoin adoption grows–and the bitcoin price continues to progress to record levels–the IRS increasingly wants to make sure U.S. citizens are subject to the “bitcoin tax.” Despite IRS guidance that bitcoin is subject to income and capital gains taxes, the agency claims that only 802 people declared bitcoin profits or losses on their 2015 tax returns. Bitcoin Tracing to Increase Interest in Anonymity-Centric Coins \nUniversity of Surrey computer science professor told the Daily Beast that revelations such as this will likely further encourage the growth of anonymity-centric cryptocurrencies such as Dash, Monero, and Zcash: \nThose who are actively seeking to avoid tax, especially large amounts of tax, will move onto the next cryptocurrency that is not susceptible to the current tracking tools. \nWithin the past week, both the Dash and Monero prices have reached all-time highs . At present, Dash–the 8th-largest coin–is trading at $293 while Monero, ranked 11th is priced at $92, according to CoinMarketCap. \nFeatured image from Shutterstock. ",

      "text": "Marc Barbezat 25 août 2017 La Suisse est-elle une plate-forme de blanchiment pour les hackers? #WannaCry une histoire de $142,000 de rançons Bitcoin On espérait que les histoires de blanchiment d’argent étaient du passé avec la Suisse. Malheureusement, les hackers de WannaCry semblent avoir trouvé une passerelle suisse pour laver leur magot. Plus de 200 000 ordinateurs bloqués en mai Pour rappel, WannaCry a infecté 200 000 ordinateurs en mai, bloquant les systèmes et demandant env. 300 $ en bitcoin aux victimes souhaitant récupérer leurs fichiers. Bien que beaucoup de spécialistes croient que les agresseurs étaient davantage préoccupés à perturber le net plutôt que de rançonner, les auteurs du piratage ont commencé à blanchir les 143 000 $ en bitcoin récupérés. Pour ce faire, ils ont d’abord divisé l’argent dans les trois portefeuilles connus pour être utilisés par WannaCry, avant d’envoyer les fonds à Shapeshift.io pour la conversion en Monero , une monnaie difficile à tracer. En août, aux dernières nouvelles, les pirates n’avaient pas encore déplacé tout l’argent. Seulement 13,5 bitcoins (env. 40 000 $) sur 51,9 avaient alors été déplacés selon les informations recueillies par Forbes dans son article référencé ci-dessous. ShapeShift, le blanchisseur suisse de crypto-monnaie? Forbes rapporte que les pirates de WannaCry ransomware ont changé leur bitcoin en utilisant la plate-forme d’échange ShapeShift localisée en Suisse, dans le canton de Zoug . Sur son site, ShapeShift se décrit de la manière suivante: ShapeShift is a web and API platform formed in August of 2014 to provide instant Bitcoin and altcoin conversion with the maximum level of consumer protection and efficiency. Le site précise également que Users do not have to create accounts, deposit funds, or provide private personal information. This keeps the users safe from identity or financial theft – a critical improvement in exchange technology. Le site ne requiert donc pas d’identification formelle des utilisateurs de la plate-forme. Pas étonnant alors que les pirates de WannaCry aient souhaité profiter de cette anonymité. As of today, we have taken measures to blacklist all addresses associated with the WannaCry attackers that are known to the ShapeShift team, as is our policy for any transactions we deem breach our terms of service. We are closely watching the situation as it continues to unfold as to block any further addresses associated. cryptocoinsnews.com Néanmoins et heureusement comme le rapporte cryptocoinsnews.com, ShapeShift n’a pas l’intention de devenir la plate-forme des cybercriminels et collabore avec les forces de l’ordre. La bonne réaction de l’équipe ShapeShift les préserve de devenir une plate-forme de blanchiment mais les défis restent énormes. La réglementation continue de courir derrière la technologie et ses innovations. Voici encore un florilège d’articles en lien avec cette actualité: WannaCry Hackers Are Using This Swiss Company To Launder $142,000 Bitcoin Ransoms Remember those pesky WannaCry ransomware hackers? They’re starting to shift their bitcoin around and Forbes has learned they’re using a Swiss cryptocurrency exchange called ShapeShift to do it. WannaCry infected as many as 200,000 computers when it broke out in May, locking up systems and demanding $300 in bitcoin from victims wanting their files back. ShapeShift is Assisting Police to Trace Cashed Out Bitcoin From WannaCry Ransomware Get Trading Recommendations and Read Analysis on Hacked.com for just $39 per month. CyberScoopNews journalist Patrick O’Neill revealed on August 3 that ShapeShift, the cryptocurrency market’s most popular instant digital asset exchange, began to assist law enforcement to track bitcoin received and traded by the distributors and developers of the WannaCry ransomware. Bitcoin Exchange ShapeShift Helps Police As WannaCry Attacker Converts To Monero Exchanges ShapeShift and Changelly cooperating with police after it emerged that the WannaCry attackers used it to convert Bitcoin to Monero. As multiple sources report, the fairly modest sums the hackers gained from the international cyberattack have made their way through the two exchanges for the equivalent in Monero (XMR). Digital exchange joins law enforcement in hunt for WannaCry ransom bitcoins Patrick O’Neill, a journalist at CyberScoopNews, has claimed that since August 3rd, ShapeShift has been helping law enforcement to trace bitcoin transactions between WannaCry ransomware distributors and developers. The reason behind ShapeShift’s involvement in the investigation is that Bitcoin withdrawn for the ransomware were exchanged for Monero on this platform. Wannacry money laundering attempt thwarted – BBC News The hackers behind the Wannacry ransomware have tried to conceal who they are by using a virtual currency that is more anonymous than Bitcoin. Victims paid more than $140,000 (£107,000) in bitcoins to recover files scrambled by Wannacry. Earlier this week the gang behind the attack started to move the bitcoins out of the wallets they were paid into. et pour en savoir plus sur ShapeShift:",

      "text": "Browse: Home Mainstream Bitcoin Bitcoin Price Targets $4,400 Despite Dipping Hashrate Bitcoin Price Targets $4,400 Despite Dipping Hashrate   Bitcoin Price Targets $4,400 Despite Dipping Hashrate \nGet Trading Recommendations and Read Analysis on Hacked.com for just $39 per month. \nDespite the hopes of some investors, the market had already priced in SegWit activation, so the bitcoin price remained mostly stable yesterday following the protocol upgrade’s deployment. However, the bitcoin price began to climb on Thursday, and despite a dipping hashrate, it appears bitcoin has $4,400 in its sights. Chart from CoinMarketCap \nBitcoin’s progress, combined with slight bumps to the bitcoin cash and ethereum prices, hoisted the total value of all cryptocurrencies to $155.3 billion, a new all-time high. Chart from CoinMarketCap Bitcoin Price Targets $4,400 \nSince briefly dropping to $3,675 on August 22, the bitcoin price has strung together a three-day advance. That rally continued on Friday, as the bitcoin price rose 4% to $4,360. Bitcoin is now approaching $4,400 and is only $110 from surpassing its current CoinMarketCap record of $4,470. Bitcoin now has a $72 billion market cap. Bitcoin Price Chart from CoinMarketCap \nBitcoin is approaching record levels even as it deals with wild fluctuations in its network hashrate. This network volitility stems from miners moving back and forth from bitcoin to bitcoin cash to mine the most profitable blockchain. Combined BTC and BCH Hashrate | Chart from Fork.lol \nSince the bitcoin cash network has the ability to frequently adjust mining difficulty, mining pools move their hashpower there when it is profitable to mine, and then quickly switch back to bitcoin when BCH difficulty increases. At present, bitcoin cash is about 14% more profitable, which is moving the two hashrates closer to parity. Ethereum Price Inches Past $330 \nThe ethereum price continued its leisurely latter-week climb, rising another 2% to $332. This increased its market cap to $31.3 billion, although its daily trading volume has tapered below $1 billion. Ethereum Price Chart from CoinMarketCap Bitcoin Cash Price Holds Above $660 \nLike ethereum, bitcoin cash volume has plummeted this week, mostly because Korean traders have moved on to other coins, such as Monero and Ripple . However, the bitcoin cash price has demonstrated that it has support above the $600 threshold. That pattern continued on Friday, as the bitcoin cash price recovered from a Thursday evening dip to return a 24-hour gain of 2%. At present, the bitcoin cash price is $665, resulting in a market cap of $11 billion. Bitcoin Cash Price Chart from CoinMarketCap Ripple Price Gets Clobbered \nFew top-tier altcoins saw significant movement on Friday, but there was one major exception. Ripple, the cryptocurrency with the fourth-largest market cap, plunged by 20% after rumors that it would make a major announcement regarding an Asia partnership did not pan out. The ripple price is still significantly higher than it was before this week’s rapid climb, but it has been reduced by nearly one-third since peaking at $0.30 earlier in the week. Altcoin Price Chart from CoinMarketCap \nThe litecoin price also receded, declining 2% after crossing $50 for the first time in August. IOTA and NEM each rose about 4%, maintaining the $40 million distance between their two market caps. NEO and ethereum classic, on the other hand, each declined about 1.5%. \nDash and Monero, the two largest anonymity-centric altcoins, rose 6% and 14%, respectively. Both have seen significant movement this week, which is likely partially-related to the revelation that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service has been using transaction-tracing software since 2015 to unmask bitcoin users they suspect of tax evasion. \nFeatured image from Shutterstock.",

      "title": "New CS:GO Cheating App for MacOS Contains a Malicious Monero Miner – The Merkle",
      "text": "Pin Shares 17 \nUsers of the MacOS operating system should steer clear of a new CS:GO “cheat” known as vHook. Anyone who plays Counter-Strike: Global Offense is always looking to gain a competitive edge in one way or another. Resorting to cheats is frowned upon, but it is also the only option in the minds of some players. The new vHook cheating app for MacOS should not be trusted, as it installs nefarious cryptocurrency mining software on devices. CS:GO Cheating on MacOS Has Multiple Consequences \nWe never condone cheating of any kind when it comes to online gaming, especially if that game is part of the growing eSports industry. CS:GO is one of the most well-known games in the world, and it is both competitive and fun to play. However, the game is haunted by cheaters who try to take advantage of technologies such as vHook applications. Addressing these cheats has been quite a challenge, yet it has also attracted the attention of cybercriminals looking to get their hands on some more cryptocurrency. \nCriminals are now packaging a new CS:GO vHook cheating app containing cryptocurrency mining malware. Interestingly, this new toolkit is designed specifically for MacOS users. The vast majority of CS:GO gamers use the Windows operating system, thus targeting MacOS users seems like a weird decision. Only time will tell if any MacOS gamers are affected by the new malware distribution campaign. \nUnfortunately, there is a precedent for packaging a CS:GO cheating tool with malware. A similar incident occurred back in December of 2016. That particular malware had nothing to do with cryptocurrency mining, though. Instead, the toolkit successfully rewrote a player’s master boot record altogether, which prevented their machine from rebooting. It was a way to successfully eliminate some of the other competitive CS:GO players, although the method of attack raised a lot of questions at the time. \nIt appears this new CS:GO vHook cheating app for MacOS is distributed through the Vlonc.cc website. Knowing which website distributes this malware-laden package should make it easier for researchers to ensure it is taken offline. Whether or not that will actually happen remains to be seen. The website has been around for quite some time and is still accessible at the time of writing. The tool also has a few dedicated YouTube advertisement videos to help spread awareness. It is based on the original vHook cheating app, which has been around for almost as long as the game exists. \nWhat is rather remarkable is the cryptocurrency mining malware itself. This is another instance of cybercriminals actively distributing malware capable of mining the Monero cryptocurrency. Since Monero is far more anonymous than Bitcoin – and rather profitable as well – it makes a lot more sense to hijack other people’s computing resources to mine XMR instead of BTC. The malware goes by the name OSX.Pwnet.A and has been specially modified to wreak havoc in the MacOS ecosystem. \nAs we have seen with other types of cryptocurrency mining malware, the criminals use the MinerGate pool to mine XMR with other people’s computers. This has become somewhat of a trend and two user accounts have been identified as participants in this malware’s distribution. The malware itself is a rewritten Minergate-cli package written for the QT framework. There is also evidence of this malware having been developed by a criminal distributing yet another type of cryptocurrency miner.

Interestingly enough, one of Monero’s “competitors” is showing some positive signs of life. Dash has gone up by as much as 11% over the past 24 hours, which is quite significant. All of this goes to show there is a growing demand for privacy and anonymity in the world of cryptocurrency these days. Once Bitcoin gets some more features in this regard, there will be even more market competition. Dash Price Tries to Stay Above",

The crypto currency wallet has to be treated as your primary email account in terms of security. Bitcoins and ethereum blockchain is so big that creating a local wallet and recovering in case of a system crash is big headache. We have many other cryptocurrencies that can be exchanged with bitcoins. Monero coins are now trending higher. I personally prefer AEON coin as its price is less at present and has potential to move like monero. Creating a local wallet and syncing is faster that monero.

      "text": "Browse: Home Mainstream Bitcoin The IRS Has Tracked Bitcoin Tax Evaders Since 2015 The IRS Has Tracked Bitcoin Tax Evaders Since 2015   The IRS Has Tracked Bitcoin Tax Evaders Since 2015 \nGet Trading Recommendations and Read Analysis on Hacked.com for just $39 per month. \nThere’s a common misconception among both legislators and the general public that bitcoin is an untraceable asset used exclusively by drug dealers, terrorists, and other maleficent groups. The truth is, with time, the right software, and the strong arm of the law, it’s often possible to put a name to a seemingly-anonymous bitcoin address. IRS Tracking Bitcoin Tax Evaders \nSince 2015, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has been using bitcoin transaction analysis software developed by Chainalysis to “trace the movement of money through the bitcoin economy,” according to contract documents obtained by The Daily Beast. \nThe contract , which was revealed following a Freedom of Information Act request, details the lengths to which the IRS is willing to go to prevent U.S. residents from using cryptocurrency to evade bitcoin tax obligations. \nSpecifically, the IRS has paid Chainalysis more than $88,700 for access to its anti-money laundering software. The company’s “Reactor” software, for instance, is marketed as an “interactive investigative tool” that organizations or law enforcement agencies can use to “track, apprehend, and convict money launderers and cyber criminals.” From the Chainalysis website : \nThrough formal partnerships with Europol and other international law enforcement, our investigative tools have been used globally to successfully track, apprehend, and convict money launderers and cyber criminals. \nWhile blockchain-tracking software such as Reactor does not explicitly reveal the identity of bitcoin address owners, it provides them with a powerful tool to track coins as they move from one wallet to another. Once the coins are transferred to an entity subject to AML/KYC compliance–such as an exchange–law enforcement could obtain and issue a subpoena to the exchange to find out the customer’s identity. \nIn the case of a criminal network, law enforcement would then have clues about the owners of bitcoin addresses that had interacted with those owned by the now-unmasked individual. \nThe revelation that the IRS has been using bitcoin-tracing software since 2015 comes as the agency is embroiled in a legal dispute with Coinbase over whether or not the U.S.-based bitcoin exchange will have to reveal customer identities and other personal information of suspected bitcoin tax cheats. \nAs bitcoin adoption grows–and the bitcoin price continues to progress to record levels–the IRS increasingly wants to make sure U.S. citizens are subject to the “bitcoin tax.” Despite IRS guidance that bitcoin is subject to income and capital gains taxes, the agency claims that only 802 people declared bitcoin profits or losses on their 2015 tax returns. Bitcoin Tracing to Increase Interest in Anonymity-Centric Coins \nUniversity of Surrey computer science professor told the Daily Beast that revelations such as this will likely further encourage the growth of anonymity-centric cryptocurrencies such as Dash, Monero, and Zcash: \nThose who are actively seeking to avoid tax, especially large amounts of tax, will move onto the next cryptocurrency that is not susceptible to the current tracking tools. \nWithin the past week, both the Dash and Monero prices have reached all-time highs . At present, Dash–the 8th-largest coin–is trading at $293 while Monero, ranked 11th is priced at $92, according to CoinMarketCap. \nFeatured image from Shutterstock.",

      "text": "What is Kovri and Why is it Important for Monero? Date: in: Bitcoin 0 Views \nIn a recent OpenHours episode released August 17, several Monero contributors joined the show to talk about the Kovri project. The project aims to further improve the privacy of the Monero network by making it virtually impossible to deduct any information about transactions. Also, Kovri may potentially become the go-to method to hide IP addresses. Contents 4 Kovri is Important for Privacy, not Just Monero Kovri’s Resonance with Monero \nKovri is a C++ implementation of an I2P router. In short, a general purpose anonymizing overlay network, similar to Tor. A typical I2P router is written in Java, whereas Kovri is written in the C++ language to ensure compatibility with the privacy-centric cryptocurrency, monero (XMR). At present, 48 contributors are working on the project to bring it to alpha stage. Sponsored Links \nWhat is Kovri and how did it come about? Riccardo Spagni, the lead maintainer of the Monero project, explained that “because Monero is pro-privacy as a project, we started to adopt other projects, that are not only beneficial to the monero ecosystem but beneficial to privacy lovers everywhere, and that’s where Kovri came about.” \nThe beginning of Kovri mirrors that of Monero. Both were forked away from open-source projects due to a lack of belief in the direction of the original development teams. In Monero’s case, it was BitMonero. With Kovri, it was i2pd. \nIn early 2015, the initial author of i2pd, a C++ implementation of I2P, made themselves sole contributor once one developer pushed a commit through on GitHub. Offending other developers, this action resulted in the inertia of such a C++ project. Then in Autumn 2015, Anonimal, who currently leads the development of Kovri, tried to resuscitate the project and offered an olive branch to the active i2pd developers. \nWhile the first author of i2pd did not respond, the individual instead began to work on GitHub again, outside of the community driven branch. An act of defiance on the one hand and a warning sign for developers who wanted to pursue such a project. \nTo mitigate any damage to the prospects of a C++ implementation of I2P, Anonimal led a series of meetings which formed the basis for the Kovri project, starting from November 2015. This group then forked away from i2pd due to the stranglehold placed on its development. \nAnonimal explained Kovri’s purpose on the OpenHours episode, his first public discussion of the project, “Essentially, we will be able to anonymize monero transactions even more than what monero is capable of doing right now, technically speaking, at the network layer.” \nIn Anonimal’s proposal from late 2016, he explained his reasoning for Kovri as an alternative to Tor: \n“While I love Tor tremendously and will defend her with tooth and nail, at this time of writing there are two issues that concern me the most with regard to the Tor project: \nFirst, with new management, the current state of the project is in questionable flux: core volunteers who have been with the project since its very early years are uprooting and leaving, there are publicly known conflicts within the organization, there are many rumors (both founded and unfounded) about U.S. government infiltration, \nSecondly, Tor’s Achilles’s heel: authorities, consensus, and flow-based onion-routing (as current implemented in Tor): they are not truly decentralized.” \nBut doesn’t Monero obfuscate transaction destinations and transaction amounts? Yes, but when you make a transaction, you tell the network that you want it to be included in the next block. Your IP address, along with other metadata, is leaked. But your IP address is not recorded forever in the blockchain. \nMalicious actors could try to figure out IP addresses if they actively monitor the network and explains why Kovri is so important. Monero contributor SamsungGalaxyPlayer (SGP) stated, “[Kovri] will make it very, very hard, hopefully impossible, to monitor this information.” \nSpagni added that, although possible, such as attack would be difficult to pull off, “your IP address is not embedded in the transaction. They need to be running nodes of their own, and then observing which node first broadcasts a transaction, so it’s a hard attack to pull off, it has happened with bitcoin before, and maybe it could even be happening with monero, we wouldn’t know…” “Monero Will Never Be Done… Kovri Important for Privacy and Decentralization” \nOne of the more interesting questions pitched on the episode was as follows; let’s assume Kovri is integrated and there are mobile wallets for XMR, what are the largest, long-term challenges facing Monero? \nSGP responded that the biggest two challenges are for monero to stay decentralized and to keep improving the privacy. “We don’t have any systems right now which are perfectly private. We need to keep getting closer and closer to that.” He went on to say that, “We’re kind of at a point where Monero is reasonably private, now we need to make it reasonably efficient.” \nBecause of the obfuscation qualities, Monero’s transactions are larger than bitcoin transactions since more data is stored on the blockchain. Trimming down these transaction sizes has been a key priority for the team. There are two fruitful avenues in this regard, as highlighted by the most recent notes from the Monero dev meeting. RingCT 2.0 and researcher Tim Ruffing’s sublinear ring signatures + CT, which has the added advantage of not requiring a trusted setup. \n“Monero will never be done, so there will always be more work. To make it more decentralized and improve the privacy, I suppose Kovri is an important aspect for both of those things.” – SGP \nAs well as improving the decentralization and privacy of Monero, Kovri will also help to boost adoption and the value of XMR. People will begin to trust the cryptocurrency more and more once they become confident that every transaction keeps them anonymous. After the beta release of Kovri, it will be on by default, meaning every user will benefit from an extra layer of I2P anonymity. Ideological Community is Driving Development \nOther talking points on the OpenHours episode were Spagni’s views on blockchain consensus and the progress being made on the development side, “what’s more interesting than the price (of XMR) is the constant growth on the development side.” \n“We’ve had new contributors flock in on the regular, some of them stay for a short while, but some of them stay for a long time, and they’re working on something without getting paid. There are some contributors who have raised funds through our crowdfunding system, but the vast majority work on Monero because they enjoy it, and find it challenging and interesting, not because they think they’re going to get rich.” – Riccardo Spagni \nLike Brandon Goodell, the Ph.D. mathematician who was on-boarded to Monero to augment the cryptocurrency, Anonimal was also funded by the community through the internal crowdfunding system for the project. He even hinted on the show that the two would work together on Kovri in the near future. \nWith more than 7,000 XMR funded for Anonimal, and as one of the veteran Monero contributors, he can work full-time on the project. Spagni noted that two developers and one researcher have been crowdfunded in such a way. He commented, “It’s nice because it just goes to prove that even though there are a lot of scams in the space… You can still have a project that is primarily ideologically driven and has a community that are willing to fund development and fund developers no problem.” Kovri is Important for Privacy, not Just Monero \nKovri is not an exclusive project to Monero. Taking aim at being an agnostic system, Kovri will be useful for anyone who may require anonymity, such as whistleblowers and journalists. \nAs Anonimal explained, “Long term, I would like to reduce what we need and improve the implementation of what we have and also to make Kovri an anonymity system agnostic application in terms of API usage. We could have Monero using the API, but Kovri could evolve into the next generation of anonymity systems… We want something that is useful to everyone, and that will also be a long-term anonymity solution for Monero.” \nWhile XMR were used to fund Anonimal, his work will have positive spillover effects, benefitting people outside of the Monero ecosystem. \nWhile Kovri has no release date, it is an exciting project that is highly anticipated by many in the cryptocurrency community. Not just valuable for Monero, Kovri is important for privacy in general too, as it will serve a double function; a standalone I2P router and an easy to use interface with the Monero GUI. \nAs Anonimal dived into the cryptography behind the project on the show, he expressed his belief that Kovri is the most exciting project a cryptographer could possibly work on: \n“[Kovri] is like a crypto smorgasbord … so it’s actually quite fun, this is the project to get into because we have so much stuff to work with and some really cool ideas that have been developed over a decade now…”",

      "text": "Standpoint Founder: Bitcoin Asset Class Will Grow Into $2 Trillion Market Aug 24, 2017 at 09:00 Markets • Investments • Other Public Protocols • Bitcoin • Ethereum • Markets News \nForget $5,000. \nAt a time when many are making short-term bets on the price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, one bitcoin bull is going a step further. Ronnie Moas, founder of Standpoint Research, is making the case cryptocurrencies will not only be a decade-long trend, but a viable asset class. \nIn fact, he's going so far as to call for a massive rise in the market cap of cryptocurrencies. His prediction? The total value of all cryptographic assets, today valued at $150 billion , will soar to $2 trillion over the next 10 years. \nAnd in a new interview, Moas walked CoinDesk through his forecast, explaining how it stems from his fundamental analysis of the capital markets and the broader macroeconomic trends he now sees in place. \nThe Standpoint founder's view stands in stark contrast to the highly bearish analysis of Peter Schiff, who called cryptocurrency a bubble, a speculative frenzy and a natural Ponzi scheme driven by \"just plain greed\" last week. \nIn the broadest sense, Moas sees the current state of the cryptocurrency market as a direct parallel to Silicon Valley during the 1990s, when a massive surge of innovation created new technologies that transformed the way we work and live and ushered in a period of massive wealth creation. \nHe explained: \n\"I am not any more concerned with bitcoin being at a record high than Amazon or Google investors were concerned when those share prices jumped hundreds of percent and hit $100 and $200 many years ago. Today, both of those stocks are above $900. The question is not where we are at – it is where are we going? I do not think we are in a bubble.\" Roadmap to $2 trillion \nHow does Moas get to the $2 trillion market cap for cryptocurrency in his forecast? \nHe begins by looking at the $200 trillion that is currently invested in global capital markets today, including all major asset classes: cash, stocks, bonds and gold. Moas, who also does traditional equity analysis, begins his market breakdown with stocks, which he believes are currently overvalued. \nAccording to Moas, three-quarters of the names in the S&P 500 are trading at least 18 times earnings, which is higher than his value threshold of 12 times earnings. He also adds that we haven't had a stock market correction in 20 months. \nOn the currency front, the U.S. dollar is currently losing 1 to 2 percent per year due to inflation. Moas also points out that the dollar has lost half its value since he was in high school 35 years ago. \nFrom a global perspective, where most people don't have access to U.S. dollars, Moas believes the case for cryptocurrency is even more compelling: \n\"Now, imagine what they think of their own local currencies elsewhere in the world. Imagine you live in Venezuela and you're keeping your money under the mattress. Would you rather leave it there in Venezuelan bolivar or would you rather put it in bitcoin? It's not going to take you very long to make that decision.\" \nBreaking his thesis down further, Moas believes that a conservative estimate is that at least 1 percent of the $200 trillion now tied up in stocks, cash, gold and bonds will migrate into cryptocurrencies over the next decade. \nIn that case, he says, \"Bitcoin could end up with a market capitalization that is more than Amazon and Apple combined.\" \nUnder this scenario, that would mean that the current market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies would naturally grow. \nAnd if Moas's market capitalization targets are correct, investors would then receive a 1,250 percent return on their cryptocurrency investments made today. Diversified strategy \nBut he adds one major caveat to that prediction. Simply, \"You've got to be in the right names.\" \nAssuming you accept Moas's basic bull market thesis for cryptocurrencies, how do you know if you are invested in the right \"names\" in the cryptocurrency space? And, if the market boom in cryptocurrency is analogous to the roaring years of the 1990s tech boom, how can you avoid investing in the next Pets.com? \nAs Moas frames it: \n\"A lot of people say there is a bubble out there. I see a bubble when you get down below the top 50 cryptocurrencies. There are more than 800 names right now. In my view, what happens outside the top 50 is irrelevant.\" \nMoas goes on to point out that 91 percent of the nearly $150 billion market cap is invested in the top 20 names and 70 percent is invested in bitcoin and ether alone. \nHe recommends, for the purposes of portfolio diversification, retail investors should hedge their bets and invest across the top 10 or 20 cryptocurrencies. \nIn Moas's view, the 800 cryptocurrencies that are now trading are analogous to the 800 stocks that were available on the Nasdaq at the height of the dot-com bubble nearly 20 years ago. While Amazon and Apple and Microsoft emerged to become among the most valuable companies of all time, there were many companies from that time period that died slow and painful deaths. \nOr, as Moas more colorfully puts it: \"Back then, there were hundreds of pump-and-dump, small-cap junk names just as there are in crypto today. Today, the crypto market is giving you the same signals with names like dash, ripple, litecoin, monero, bitcoin, ethereum , neo, nem, iota and others.\" \nHe went on to add that while there are certainly risks involved in investing in cryptocurrency, those risks are, in his view, outweighed by the possibility of 10-to-one or 20-to-one payout to the upside experienced by tech stocks. The bull case \nOf all the major cryptocurrencies, though, Moas seems especially bullish in his view of bitcoin. Unless there is a major shakeup in the underlying confidence, he believes that investors are going to want to buy-and-hold for their portfolios for 10 years or more. \nMoas points out that there are currently only about 16 million bitcoins that have been issued of a possible total 21 million coins that will be created. \nIn his analysis, this could lead to tens of millions of people trying to get their hands on just a few million coins. \nWhen asked for a specific price target, Moas summed up as follows: \n\"At the beginning of July, bitcoin was trading at $2,500. I believe in the next three years you will probably see $15,000 to $20,000 for bitcoin. It could double twice from here in the next 36 months.\" \nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Ripple. \nRonnie Moas image via CNBC /Youtube   Interested in offering your expertise or insights to our reporting?

      "text": "\nFacebook Why Monero? Secure: Using the power of a distributed peer-to-peer consensus network every transaction is cryptographically secured. Individual accounts have a 25 word mnemonic seed displayed when created, and can be written down to backup the account . Account files are encrypted with a passphrase to ensure they are useless if stolen. Private: Monero uses a cryptographically sound system to allow you to send and receive funds without your transactions being easily revealed on the blockchain (the distributed ledger of transactions). This ensures that your purchases, receipts, and all transfers remain absolutely private by default. Untraceable: By taking advantage of ring signatures , a special property of certain types of cryptography, Monero is able to ensure that transactions are not only untraceable, but have an optional measure of ambiguity that ensures that transactions cannot easily be tied back to an individual user or computer.

Benchmarks A Look At The Xeon Gold 6138 + Tyan GT24E-B7106 1U Linux Server Performance \nLast week I began testing the Tyan GT24E-B7106, a 1U barebones server designed for Intel’s new Xeon Scalable processors. I am still carrying out many benchmarks of the Tyan GT24E-B7106 paired with two of the Xeon Gold 6138 CPUs, but for those curious about the Linux performance potential of this server when slotting in 96GB of DDR4-2666 RDIMMs and these two CPUs that yield a combined total of 40 cores / 80 threads, here are some initial benchmarks. Applications GIMP 2.9.6 Released \nAfter more than a year of hard work we are excited to release GIMP 2.9.6 featuring many improvements, some new features, translation updates for 23 languages, and 204 bug fixes. \nAs usual, for a complete list of changes please see NEWS. Here we’d like to focus on the most important changes. GIMP 2.9.6 Released With GEGL Multi-Threading & Better HiDPI Support \nWe are one step closer to the long-awaited GIMP 2.10 update with today seeing the newest development release, GIMP 2.9.6. \nWith GIMP 2.9.6 being the first official development release in more than one year, it’s quite feature heavy. First up, GIMP 2.9.6 is now finally multi-threaded for modern processors! The GEGL implementation now handles multi-threading! They do expect some bug reports to come in, but as a workaround, via the preferences area GIMP can be limited to a defined number of threads. OpenCL support also remains available. Taking over siphashc for Python \nSince some time we’re using siphash algorithm to speed up looking up strings in Weblate. Even though it is used by Python internally, it’s not exposed in the standard library so several third party modules appeared in the PyPI. Out of all these siphashc or rather it’s Python 3 fork siphashc3 seemed to perform best, so I’ve started to use that. Double Commander – An Excellent Dual Pane File Manager for Linux \nIf you have been following our reviews for up to 4 months then you must have come across fman, a present day file manager for power users. It is feature-rich with native support for dual-pane display and a plethora of keyboard shortcuts, among other features. \nToday, I bring you another relatively powerful file manager that is arguably as feature-rich and powerful. It’s called Double Commander. Take a Break – Force Yourself To Take Breaks Away From Your Computer \nTake a Break is a petite application you can use to sort of force yourself to take breaks away from your computer after a configurable work time. \nIt works by dividing time into 2 sections: up-time and break-time. Up-time is when your system isn’t active and when that time is up the computer switches to break time during which the screen takes on a handful of display options including screen upside-down, dimmed, and screen saver. \nI have written on Gnome Pomodoro and Go For It which are both nice productivity timer apps, but neither of them forces you to actually go away by locking you out of your workspace. Maybe, Take a Break is what you have been looking for. Instructionals/Technical Wine Staging 2.15 released with more Direct3D 11 improvements \nThe latest Wine Staging build 2.15 is now available and it brings in some more Direct3D 11 improvements. \nUsual reminder: Wine Staging is the testing area for features and patches to eventually make their way into the main Wine development builds and later stable releases. \nBuilding off last weekend’s Wine 2.15 development release is now a re-based Wine-Staging version that also includes some new testing/experimental patches. Games Fun to Play Open Source Turn-Based Strategy Games \nIf you adore hectic racing games, death-defying first person shooters, entertaining arcade classics, or nervy tower defense games, this article might not up your street. Here we’re covering turn-based strategy games that require intelligence, and the ability to come up with an innovative plan that will leave the competition mesmerized. As the title indicates, we are covering a genre where players take turns when playing, strategically seeking to outsmart the enemy. \nMany of the biggest computer games concentrate on explosion-filled genres. But there is a place for high quality turn-based strategy games. It’s a neglected genre in the mainstream, yet contains many marvelous titles. The genre might conjure thoughts of board games with dice and individualized pieces. But, now, they can use the latest technology to make more realistic and immersive experiences. The Enduring Legacy of Zork \nDuring its 1980s heyday, commercial versions of Zork released for personal computers sold more than 800,000 copies. Today, unofficial versions of the game can be played online, on smartphones, and on Amazon Echo devices, and Zork is inspiring young technologists well beyond the gaming field. The Civilization VI “Summer Update” for Linux will not feature cross-platform multiplayer \nSad news for those waiting on it, as Aspyr Media have again delayed cross-platform multiplayer for the Linux version of Civilization VI [Steam]. Bundle Stars offer $140 worth of games for just $3.49 in its Indie Legends 6 bundle \nBundle Stars has once again churned out some great discounts, with the launch of its Indie Legends 6 bundle offering. This deal trades nine indie games – including Goat Simulator – all worth $139.87, for just $3.49. These games have a combined average user rating of 87%. Desktop Environments/WMs GSOC 2017 Keysign wrap up \nThe transfer of the keys on GNOME Keysign was limited to the LAN only. This limitation can be a problem when e.g. one user does not have access to a WIFI/Ethernet connection or when the users are connected to an isolated network (like a guest WIFI or an University Intranet). Code Search for GNOME Builder : Final report \nThis is the final report for my GSOC Project Code Search for GNOME Builder. First I want to thank to Christian Hergert for helping me in this project. I successfully achieved 2 objectives in this project, fuzzy search of symbols in the project and improving Go to Definition in GNOME Builder. Here is the final code GitHub of this project which will be merged. Meet the Saner, Streamlined GNOME Settings App [Video] \nAs you may be aware, the GNOME Control Center is getting some long overdue love and attention in GNOME 3.26. The macOS inspired icon grid used since the early days of GNOME 3 gives way to a cleaner, saner side-bar based layout, punctuated with some sleek new symbolic icons. GNOME Control Center Switches To Its New Settings Layout \nGeorges Stavracas has announced that for GNOME 3.25.91 they have finished up work on their new GNOME Settings user-interface, a.k.a. the redesign to the GNOME Control Center. \nThe new settings layout is now used by default, now that they finished up the new GNOME Network panel for this settings area. With the new UI they are rebranding GNOME Control Center as GNOME Settings. Introducing Settings (or, the new Control Center) \nif you’re following the GNOME development closely, you’re now more than aware of this movement of reworking GNOME Control Center. It was a remarkably colossal work, specially because we used a bottom-up approach: fix the panels, then switch to the new shell. SUSE Now Offers Linux Enterprise Server for SAP Applications on the Google Cloud \nSUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP Applications is now available as the operating system for SAP solutions on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP), allowing enterprise customers to become more agile and reduce operating costs by only paying for what they use \nIf Brazil, one of the world biggest producers of beef, would announce to stop producing fish: would you wonder, whether Peru, one of the world biggest producers of fish, would stop producing fish? \nYou probably wouldn’t. \nIf one of the rather small contributors to the btrfs filesystem announced to not support btrfs for production systems: should you wonder, whether SUSE, strongest contributor to btrfs today, would stop investing into btrfs? SUSE pledges endless love for btrfs, says Red Hat’s dumping irrelevant \nSUSE has decided to let the world it has no plans to step away from the btrfs filesystem and plans to make it even better. \nThe company’s public display of affection comes after Red Hat decided not to fully support the filesystem in its own Linux. \nLosing a place in one of the big three Linux distros isn’t a good look for any package even if, as was the case with this decision, Red Hat was never a big contributor or fan of btrfs. SUSE Remains Committed To The Btrfs File-System \nWhile Red Hat is backing away from Btrfs support in favor of their next-gen Stratis project and mature Linux file-systems like EXT4 and XFS, SUSE is reaffirming their support for Btrfs. \nSUSE was the first to significantly back Btrfs by making it the default file-system in SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12. While other major distributions haven’t been following in that same direction and Red Hat recently deprecating their Btrfs support, SUSE has made it clear they will continue investing in Btrfs. \nMicroOS is SUSE’s modern and slightly different take on cluster computing for containers and microservices. This is what you ought to know about it. Red Hat Family Red Hat Says Goodbye to Btrfs — Is Stratis the Future? \nIt wasn’t long ago that Red Hat was revering Btrfs and praising it as not only a viable storage solution, but an excellent one. Today, Btrfs is thought to pair very well with GlusterFS (a form of networked redundant storage) for data center use, and still an amazing solution for many other applications. Yet, Red Hat has bid adieu with the recent decision to deprecate Btrfs as a storage solution moving forward. Finance \nAs you probably know, there is annual convention called Flock. This year’s is happening in Cape Cod, Hyannis, MA and will begin the morning of Tuesday, August 29. Sessions will continue each day until midday on Friday, September 1. \nI have asked all of the session leaders from Flock some questions. Debian Family SnapRoute Integrates its FlexSwitch with Canonical’s Ubuntu \nSnapRoute and Canonical joined forces to create an integrated software stack for white-box switch deployments. They’re combining SnapRoute’s FlexSwitch and Canonical’s Ubuntu operating system for cloud environments. \nThe FlexSwitch+Ubuntu stack is certified on multiple white-box switches including the Facebook Wedge 100, according to the partners. Canonical announces further enterprise Kubernetes support options \nCanonical continues to push forward with its Kubernetes container DevOps management plans. In its latest move, Ubuntu Linux’s parent company announced two consulting packages for enterprise Kubernetes deployments. In addition, it’s offering expanded enterprise support with partners. This will include Galactic Fog’s serverless infrastructure, Rancher’s container management workflow, and Weaveworks’ Weave Cloud. \nThis comes as Canonical prepares for an initial public offering (IPO). These moves are both to gain new cloud and container customers and to show that Canonical is laser-focused on the enterprise market. Earlier, Canonical had tried, and failed, to dominate the Linux desktop and become a smartphone leader. New Features: Ubuntu 17.10 Will Ship With Indicator Applets And New Ubuntu Dock \nUbuntu Desktop team is busy making the final transition to GNOME Shell and polishing the end user experience. To bring the best of both worlds, the team has added a new Ubuntu Dock and support for Indicator Applets. Ubuntu 17.10 will also come with the trash shortcut on the desktop. Ubuntu 17.10, codenamed Artful Aardvark, will finally arrive on October 19, 2017. No strategic change for Canonical, says Mark Shuttleworth \nMark Shuttleworth doesn’t intend to make any “significant change” to Canonical’s executive direction and strategy now that he has resumed his position as CEO. \nThe founder of Canonical, behind the open source operating system Ubuntu, retook his former post as head of the company in July, replacing the long-serving Jane Silber, who took over for him in 2010 when he transitioned to a more product-focused role. \n“She had a good stint, which was extended several times, and so now it’s my turn back at the helm,” Shuttleworth told IT Pro in an interview last week. However, he made it clear that he was not planning on making any major changes to the company’s business model. \n“She and I have worked closely throughout her tenure,” he said. “It doesn’t really represent a very significant change in executive direction, because she and I were always pretty closely aligned on how we wanted things to work.” Ubuntu System Cleaner ‘Stacer’ Has Binned Electron \nThe popular utility, which is best described as a cross between CCleaner for Ubuntu and a regular system monitor, has been rewritten in C++ for its latest release. \nYup, the Ubuntu cleaner app has binned Electron — news that will please many of you, I’m sure! \nThe rewrite also means the app now uses fewer resources when running, and is, overall, more responsive too. New Features: Ubuntu 17.10 Will Ship With Indicator Applets And New Ubuntu Dock \nUbuntu Desktop team is busy making the final transition to GNOME Shell and polishing the end user experience. To bring the best of both worlds, the team has added a new Ubuntu Dock and support for Indicator Applets. Ubuntu 17.10 will also come with the trash shortcut on the desktop. Ubuntu 17.10, codenamed Artful Aardvark, will finally arrive on October 19, 2017. Zorin OS 12.1 Lite, the Xfce one \nZorin OS 12.1 Lite is the first distribution from the Zorin team featuring Xfce desktop environment. Maybe that’s the reason why I was not too convinced with its stability. \nApart from the issue with Parole player that I mentioned above, I also received a black screen during my Live run of this operating system. The system restored after few seconds, but I was forced to enter the username (guess it: zorin without password), and all the open applications were closed. Touch-panel PCs run Raspbian on Raspberry Pi CM3 \nComfile has launched two IP65 protected, resistive touch panel PCs with 7- and 10.2-inch 800 x 480 displays, built around the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 3. \nIn February, Saelig Co. announced distribution of Janz Tec’s Raspberry Pi 3-based emPC-A/RPI3 industrial controller. Now, Saelig has launched North American distribution of Korea-based Comfile’s ComfilePi line of touch panel computers built around the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 3 (CM3) computer-on-module version of the Raspberry Pi 3. Adlink gear to showcase VMWare’s Liota based IoT framework \nAdlink will offer the new VMware Pulse IoT Center service and Linux-friendly Liota (Little IoT Agent) to Adlink customers as pre-integrated solutions. \nVMWare, which is primarily known as a virtualization software vendor, stepped into the IoT market last year by announcing a vendor-neutral, open source Liota (Little IoT Agent) SDK for building secure IoT gateway data and control orchestration applications. Recently, VMWare followed up with a VMware Pulse IoT Center IoT framework built around Liota, and it has now announced its first major hardware partner for the technology. Adlink will support the VMware Pulse IoT Center via pre-integrated solutions bundled with unnamed Adlink hardware. ARM Linux industrial computer gets EtherCat. \nInside the box are a 1GHz ARM processor running Linux , 1Gbyte of ram, a 4Gbyte eMMC memory and up to 128Gbyte of flash via a Micro SD Card. \nThe enclosure measures 132 x 86 x 35mm plus plugs, and there is a DIN rail mount option. \nEtherCat is real-time industrial Ethernet originally developed by Beckhoff Automation, with the main development focus, according to Harting, on short cycle times – not greater than 100µs, low jitter – not greater than 1µs – for accurate synchronisation and low hardware costs. Linux-based security phone to ship with source code \nPurism is crowdfunding a security minded “Librem 5” smartphone that runs Linux on an i.MX6 or i.MX8, and offers a 5-inch screen and privacy protections. \nAfter the death of Firefox OS, the discontinuation of the Ubuntu Phone, and Samsung’s painfully slow rollout of its Tizen phones, the dream of establishing alternative Linux phone platforms not called Android appeared to be heading for the dustbin of history. Lately, however, several new projects have emerged such as the Raspberry Pi Zero based ZeroPhone and Halium OS project. Learn how to completely setup your Tizen Samsung Smart TV \nAnyone who loves quality products will always dream of owning a Samsung Smart TV. You finally have your new TV and you are ready to get it setup so you can show it off to all your friends, but you will need to properly connect the cables first. Follow along with the videos below to learn everything you need to know about setting up your new Samsung Smart TV. Here you will find videos of how to identify the One Connect and power cables, insert them into the right ports on the back of your TV, and the right ports on the One Connect box. Hands-on with the Galaxy Note8: Haven’t we seen this before? \nThat’s the overwhelming feeling I got after a test drive with the Galaxy Note8. Samsung’s earlier flagship for 2017, the Galaxy S8—specifically the Galaxy S8+—is so close to the Note8 I’m not sure why anyone would wait the five months of lag time between the two devices. Q2 Smartphone Market Top 10 Numbers \nThere you go, no big changes but note, the ‘other OS’ combined category is mathematically at 0.53% so we are JUST about to round ‘other’ to zero, quite possibly in Q3 or latest by Q4. It is a two-horse race haha (which is no race, Android won this long ago). Open source professionals are more in demand than ever \nSo, you want a technology job, do you? Then you should work on your open-source skills because that’s where the jobs are. According to Dice, the leading technology job site, and The Linux Foundation, opportunities for open-source professionals are abound, as companies strive to improve efficiency and cut time to market. Open source and proprietary software solutions: the key for an analytic project \nIn the world of data analysis it may be no coincidence that open source tools like the ‘R’ statistical computing language have blossomed as analytics and big data have matured together. \nHadoop, Python… There seems to be a special kind of magic between the curious minds of data analysts (with a small ‘a’ – as they may be ‘line of business’ users that don’t have a degree in statistics or a qualification in coding) and with new ways of exploring the world. \nOpen source software has proven itself to be a very useful way of rapidly finding quality insights out about the world when out to the challenging task of finding insights from the enormous volumes of data out there. Big data analytics provides an opportunity for open source data quality tools to deliver new insights. Telstra launches open source powered security operations centre \nTelstra has formally launched the first of what is intended to be a string of Security Operations Centres (SOCs) that will deliver services to its enterprise and government customers. \nTelstra CEO Andrew Penn and the minister assisting the prime minister for cyber security, Dan Tehan, today officially opened the Sydney SOC. Organizations are desperate for open-source technology skills \nOpen-source technology skills are becoming highly sought after as organizations fight among themselves to attract the talent they need to take advantage of the burgeoning trend. \nThat’s according to the Linux Foundation’s new 2017 Open Source Jobs Survey and Report, which found that companies are increasingly looking for full-time hires to boost efficiency and reduce time to market. An open source approach to drive NFV innovation \nNetwork functions virtualisation (NFV) and software-defined networks (SDN) will play a vital role in the development and future of the telecoms industry. The hybrid network model, based on virtualised technology and hardware, has become mission critical, not just to operations but commercial success also. Telecoms is an industry traditionally steeped in proprietary solutions and insulated approaches to network development, writes Tzvika Naveh, the marketing director for NFV orchestration at Amdocs, however, the introduction of an open-source approach will help further fuel NFV and SDN commercialisation and innovation through collaboration. Understanding OPNFV Starts Here \nIf telecom operators or enterprises were to build their networks from scratch today, they would likely build them as software-defined resources, similar to Google or Facebook’s infrastructure. That’s the premise of Network Functions Virtualization (NFV). \nNFV is a once in a generation disruption that will completely transform how networks are built and operated. And, OPNFV is a leading open source NFV project that aims to accelerate the adoption of this technology. Demand for Open Source Skills Continues to Grow \nOn a scale of one to five, how are your open source skills? If you picked a number below four, you might want to do something about it. According to the Linux Foundation’s annual Open Source Jobs Report released on Wednesday, employment prospects for open source workers continues to rise. \nConsider this: 86 percent of open source professionals believe that just knowing open source has advanced their careers, with 52 percent saying it would be easy to find another job. If that doesn’t wet your whistle — only 27 percent report not receiving a recruiting call in the past six months. The Secret Sauce To Open Source \nOne of the first items discussed when companies start using and leveraging open source is the determination of what, in their IP portfolio, is the unique differentiation between themselves and their competitors. What is, in other words, their “secret sauce.” Companies can then use open source to allow them, and their development, to focus on their secret sauce and to consume, or contribute/donate, non-differentiating software to the open source community. This allows companies to focus their time, talent and resources on those aspects of technology that provide the most innovation to them and their customers. \nSome companies, known as Open Core companies, also leverage the idea of “secret sauce” in that they release their code under an Open Source license, but sell “Enterprise Extensions” as commercial products, and keep that technology private and confidential, as their own secret sauce. \nBut the most important “secret sauce” in Open Source is also the most unrecognized and most misunderstood. Ironically, science fiction understands this secret ingredient better than most. It’s the delicacy specified in the Twilight Zone’s “How To Serve Man”; it’s the basic constituent of Soylent Green; it’s Arthur C. Clarke’s “Food of the Gods.” \nIt’s people. How to handle criticism of your open project \nOver the course of the past year, the project I’m working on has been using open organizational principles as the cornerstone of the work. It’s the first attempt at using open methodologies inside of Greenpeace. The project, code named Planet 4, is the global redesign and development of Greenpeace’s digital presence. To put it quite simply, we are building a piece of software that content and web editors will use to put Greenpeace content on the web. We’re building the software on top of WordPress, a platform we selected in part because of its own open source roots. Throughout the project, we’ve used a remixed version of the Open Decision Framework to document and share everything we’re doing. Aside from me, this way of working was new to my team. YOLO: Open source real-time image recognition \nFor those of you who are looking to play around with image recognition in your UAS projects, there’s an open source real-time image recognition system for that. I am not sure yet how well this would work at longer distances with smaller images when capturing footage from a flying platform but could be interesting. I wonder if SAR and related ops could perhaps benefit from such an open source project. Gene? Events Technoshamanism at Aarhus University \nWe talked about the traditions of festivals before the festivals of technoshamanism, such as Brazilian tactical media, Digitofagy, Submidialogy, MSST (Satellitless Movement), etc. We presented the Baobáxia and the indigenous / quilombola struggles in the city and the countryside. The aesthetic manifestations of encounters of technoshamanism as well as ideas about free or postcolonial thoughts, ancestorfuturism and new Subjective territories. Moby Summit at OSS North America \nIn case you missed it, the next Moby Project Summit will take place on September 14, 2017 in Los Angeles, as part of the Open Source Summit North America. Following the success of the previous editions, we’ll keep the same format which consists of short technical talks / demos in the morning and Birds-of-a-Feather sessions in the afternoon. Databases Quest Software Releases New Platform to Tackle MySQL Open Source Environments \nQuest Software, a global systems management and security software provider, is releasing Toad Edge, a new commercial database toolset that can manage next-generation open source database environments. \nThis release will support MySQL, saving time, minimizing the MySQL learning curve, and mitigating risks that can be associated with building applications on an open source database platform. \n“It’s a brand new development and DBA administration tool for the MySQL database whether that database is running on-prem or on Amazon RDS Azure, it doesn’t matter our tool can help the developer and DBA develop an application on MySQL on-prem or in the cloud,” said Greg Davoll, Executive Director of product management and product marketing. Oracle/Java/LibreOffice Kolab Now Is a Smooth On-Ramp for LibreOffice Online \nAs cloud popularity grows, so does the collection of free or low-cost online office tools that services like Microsoft Office Online and Google Docs/G Suite provide. \nHowever, those two major league offerings, along with a swarm of other cloud-based productivity platforms, are proprietary. Open source vendors have been promising a free open source online alternative. Until now, online open source office suites have been little more than vaporware. \nYou can get your document work done fine using an open source local installation. Exchanging documents via email attachments or shared links to files stored on Dropbox and other cloud storage farms work reasonably well for low-level collaborative team tasks. \nHowever, the inconvenience factor kicks in very quickly when you try to handle collaborative tasks and need access to a continual stream of live edits. That is when a cloud-based open source office suite is sorely missed. \nKolab Systems last month announced Kolab Now, a full-featured online office suite. The launch had the blessing of The Document Foundation, which gave up on fulfilling promises for a free open source online version of the LibreOffice suite it sponsors. Healthcare Open Source Collaboration Key to Healthcare Blockchain Adoption \nInterest in healthcare blockchain continues to grow as organizations realize the potential data sharing advantages. Blockchain is not currently used in healthcare, but open source projects, such as Hyperledger, are working to develop blockchain standards that can eventually be used in healthcare. \nEntities are showing genuine interest in blockchain and are currently working on projects for future adoption, according to Hyperledger Executive Director Brian Behlendorf. \nLast year the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) hosted a healthcare blockchain essay contest in response to vendors approaching the agency and suggesting uses for blockchain in healthcare for provider directories and EHRs. The contest gave HHS a broad pool of examples from vendors and providers alike to get a better grasp on the potential reality of healthcare blockchain implementation. Pseudo-Open Source (Openwashing) Open-Source Software Won’t Ensure Election Security [Ed: So, using FUD from Microsoft affiliates, Microsoft (see signatures) attacks the idea of FOSS in voting systems to guard Microsoft’s control over the ballot box . The real issue is lack of paper trail, not just proprietary software with back doors.] BSD Rebuild of Debian using Clang 3.9, 4.0 and 5.0 \ntldr: The percentage of failure is decreasing, Clang support is improving but there is a long way to go. \nThe goal of this initiative is to rebuild Debian using Clang as a compiler instead of gcc. I have been doing this analysis for the last 6 years. \nRecently, we rebuilt the archive of the Debian archive with Clang 3.9.1 (July 6th), 4.0.1 (July 6th) and 5.0 rc2 (August 20th). \nFor various reasons, we didn’t perform a rebuild since June 2016 with version 3.8. Therefor, we took the opportunity to do three over the last month. AF3e status, 22 August 2017 \nYour irregular “Absolute FreeBSD” status report! \nIt’s at 123,700 words. 12 of 26 chapters exist as first drafts. (Yes, the last report said 7 of 24. I can’t count.) Two more chapters are partially done. One of those partially-done chapters, on “Pre-Install Considerations,” won’t be done until I finish the whole book. I keep going back to add tidbits to it. It’s complete, except when I find something else I have to add to it. Public Services/Government \nWell-established groups of public administrations working together on ICT solutions continue to attract new members, and new groups continue to form. These joint projects help to reduce IT costs and increase efficiency. Licensing/Legal Patrick McHardy and copyright profiteering \nMany in the open source community have expressed concern about the activities of Patrick McHardy in enforcing the GNU General Public License (GPL) against Linux distributors. Below are answers to common questions, based on public information related to his activities, and some of the legal principles that underlie open source compliance enforcement. \nWho is Patrick McHardy? McHardy is the former chair of the Netfilter core development team. Netfilter is a utility in the Linux kernel that performs various network functions, such as facilitating Network Address Translation (NAT)—the process of converting an Internet protocol address into another IP address. Controlling network traffic is important to maintain the security of a Linux system. Facebook Refuses to Alter React’s Open Source License \nThe Apache Foundation recently announced that Facebook’s BSD+Patents open source license has been disallowed for inclusion with Apache products. The resulting fallout has caused gnashed teeth and much soul searching for React developers and Facebook has so far refused to reconsider. Openness/Sharing/Collaboration Community building with a Q&A vs. online forum \nIf you’ve ever built an online community, you know that the sheer number of options available can be daunting. Should you set up a forum, a Q&A site, or both? Would users prefer Slack, IRC, or perhaps a mailing list? Where does Telegram fit in? Maybe you should you just set up one of every available solution… \nI’ll discuss this topic at length during the upcoming Open Source Summit North America. But in the meantime, let’s focus on one aspect to better understand the overall decision-making process. Open Data Estonia to focus presidency on free movement of data \nEstonia, holding its first Presidency of the European Council as of July, hopes to advance the EU’s digital single market by focusing on the free movement of data. One of three key suggestions in a vision paper by the country’s Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications is to encourage the cross-border exchange of public administration data on the basis of the once-only principle. Programming/Development Top 3 open source Python IDEs \nPython is everywhere. These days, it seems it powers everything from major websites to desktop utilities to enterprise software. Python has been used to write all, or parts of, popular software projects like dnf/yum, OpenStack, OpenShot, Blender, Calibre, and even the original BitTorrent client. Users as Co Developers OR The Secret of Programming Success \nAnd so I inherited popclient. Just as importantly, I inherited popclient’s user base. Users are wonderful things to have, and not just because they demonstrate that you’re serving a need, that you’ve done something right. Properly cultivated, they can become co-developers. \nAnother strength of the Unix tradition, one that Linux pushes to a happy extreme, is that a lot of users are hackers too. Because source code is available, they can be effective hackers. This can be tremendously useful for shortening debugging time. Given a bit of encouragement, your users will diagnose problems, suggest fixes, and help improve the code far more quickly than you could unaided. Oracle to open source Java Enterprise Edition (JAVA EE) \nThey say that you can never expect a favor from the corporate world without them getting some profit. Oracle seems to be shutting shop on Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) and has now decided to open source it. After earning millions from Java EE, now Oracle seems to have realized that it needs to move on. WIPO, IFPMA Adviser Sees No Problem With Trump Comments, May Become US Science Envoy \nA United States State Department science envoy quit yesterday in protest over US President Donald Trump’s pullout from the Paris climate accord and defensive comments after violence at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. But according to a press report, Peter Hotez, a past science adviser who has been a featured speaker of a UN agency and pharmaceutical industry group in Geneva, is stepping up to offer his services without concern for Trump’s actions. Hardware New Ryzen Is Running Solid Under Linux, No Compiler Segmentation Fault Issue \nAs a quick update to the AMD Linux “Performance Marginality Problem” affecting some early Ryzen processors under heavy load, today I received a new Ryzen 7 processor and indeed it’s been running strong now for the past few hours under demanding load and has yet to hit the compiler segmentation fault bug. Malaysia Inclusion In Gilead Voluntary Licence – A Product Of Compulsory Licence Pressure \nGilead’s announcement today that they would include four middle-income countries (Malaysia, Thailand, Belarus, Ukraine) in their sofosbuvir voluntary licence was a welcome surprise, and will enable millions access to their highly effective, but exorbitantly priced, drug. \nThe decision to include these countries, however, no doubt is a response to increasing pressure from within these countries to either issue a compulsory licence (CL) or a government use licence (GUL), invalidate the sofosbuvir patents, or block data exclusivity for the drug. Access To Medicines Foundation Details Methodology For 2018 AMR Benchmark \nThe Amsterdam-based Access to Medicines Foundation today published the methodology it will use for its 2018 framework for evaluating how pharmaceutical companies are taking action to limit antimicrobial resistance, addressing the rising the global problem of overuse of antibiotics leading to resistance with few new ones in the pipeline. \nThe methodology will analyse company research and development, manufacturing and production, and appropriate access and stewardship. Security Xen Hypervisor Patched for Privilege Escalation and Information Leak Flaws \nThe Xen Project has fixed five new vulnerabilities in the widely used Xen virtualization hypervisor. The flaws could allow attackers to break out of virtual machines and access sensitive information from host systems. \nAccording to an analysis by the security team of Qubes OS, an operating system that relies on Xen for its security model, most of the vulnerabilities stem from the mechanism that’s used to share memory between domains. Under Xen, the host system and the virtual machines (guests) run in separate security domains. Crunchy Data Unveils Open Source Security Compliance Automation Platform \nThe Defense Information Systems Agency released a STIG for Crunchy Data’s PostgreSQL open source database in March to provide guidance on how to deploy the database in government networks in compliance with DoD security requirements. \n“Crunchy Data’s mission is to enable enterprises to adopt open source PostgreSQL as a means to reduce [information technology] infrastructure costs and avoid unwanted vendor lock-in,” said Paul Laurence, chief operating officer of Crunchy Data. How to scan and clean malware from a Linux server \nAt first blush, you might be wondering why anyone would need to scan a Linux server for malware. Even though the Linux platform isn’t nearly as vulnerable to malware as other systems, that doesn’t mean your email or file server can’t host malicious files that could take down a connected (and vulnerable) machine. Say, for instance, your Linux server uses Samba to allow users to store files. Or maybe it’s a cloud server that allows users to sync and share their files to various devices. How do you know a user hasn’t inadvertently uploaded a malicious file to the server? You don’t, unless you take action. GCHQ Knew FBI Wanted To Arrest MalwareTech, Let Him Fly To The US To Be Arrested There \nIt looks like the UK found an easy way to avoid another lengthy extradition battle. Its intelligence agency, GCHQ, knew something security research Marcus Hutchins didn’t — and certainly didn’t feel obliged to tell him. Not only that, but it let a criminal suspect fly out of the country with zero pre-flight vetting. (Caution: registration wall ahead.) Wanted: Weaponized exploits that hack phones. Will pay top dollar \nIn a sign of the soaring demand for zeroday attacks that target software that’s becoming increasingly secure, a market-leading broker is offering serious cash for weaponized exploits that work against Signal, WhatsApp, and other mobile apps that offer confidential messaging or privacy. Latest Linux Mining Malware Uses Minergate’s Monero Pool \nIt has been a while since we last saw a new malware threat in the form of a cryptocurrency miner. Do not be mistaken in thinking cybercriminals have given up on the idea, though. A new cryptocurrency mining malware referred to as Linux.BTCMine.26 is actively distributed to Linux computers using default Telnet credentials. Unlike what the name suggests, it does not mine Bitcoin but is more interested in Monero. Additionally, it only targets X86-64 and ARM hardware-based devices. Google Improves Security in Android 8.0 Oreo \nGoogle officially announced the latest iteration of its mobile operating system on August 21 with the debut of Android 8.0 Oreo. While performance is one of the headline features in the new release, Google is also implementing multiple security enhancements in Oreo as well. Reporting on Trump’s Afghan Escalation Omits Dead Afghan Civilians \nUS media also continued their rich tradition of not blaming the US or Trump for the war—instead laying responsibility at the feet of some unknown geopolitical dark matter that has forced the US to occupy Afghanistan permanently. The US isn’t waging ongoing war in the Central Asian country; it is simply “stuck,” according to the AP (8/21/17) and the Washington Post’s Karen Tumulty. Trump isn’t continuing the occupation; according to the Sacramento Bee (8/21/17); he “Keeps US Stuck in Afghanistan Quagmire.” The US doesn’t seek further war and occupation, but to “break free from the quagmire,” the Chicago Tribune (8/22/17) spells out.* Bush, Obama and Trump didn’t make a deliberate choice to bomb Afghanistan, according to PBS’s Judy Woodruff (8/21/17); attacking the country just became “the burden of three presidents.” War was consistently depicted as being thrust upon the US government by forces outside of its control. \nThe number of Afghan civilians killed during the 16-year US military occupation is well over 31,000, according to researchers at Brown University. The average American couldn’t possibly know this fact, since it’s almost never mentioned when weighing the cost/benefit ratio of further military occupation and bombing. \nA troubling paradox in world leaders is their apparent love for their own children while showing callous disregard for the lives of children and other innocents at the receiving end of their bombs and bullets, as Philip A Farruggio observes. Transparency/Investigative Reporting Senate bill would label WikiLeaks ‘non-state hostile intelligence service’ \nCongress will formally consider WikiLeaks a “non-state hostile intelligence service” if lawmakers adopt the annual Intelligence Authorization Act passed 14-1 by a Senate panel last month — a provision the bill’s sole dissenter now cites as his reason for rejecting it. \nSen. Ron Wyden, Oregon Democrat and the only member of the Senate Intelligence Committee to cast a ballot against the 2018 authorization act during last month’s vote, said Tuesday his decision was driven by the inclusion of language specifically targeting WikiLeaks, the antisecrecy website responsible for publishing millions of pages’ worth of U.S. state secrets ranging from military documents and diplomatic cables to internal Democratic Party emails. \nThe provision was included at the very end of the annual intelligence authorization act passed in committee and quietly introduced in the full Senate on Friday amid summer recess. Former NSA Official Sure DNC Wasn’t Hacked \nWilliam Binney, a former “highly placed NSA official,” told investigative journalist Aaron Klein he’s convinced the Democratic National Committee wasn’t even hacked, much less that it was hacked by Russians seeking to do damage to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. Senate bill would label WikiLeaks ‘non-state hostile intelligence service’ \nCongress will formally consider WikiLeaks a “non-state hostile intelligence service” if lawmakers adopt the annual Intelligence Authorization Act passed 14-1 by a Senate panel last month — a provision the bill’s sole dissenter now cites as his reason for rejecting it. \nSen. Ron Wyden, Oregon Democrat and the only member of the Senate Intelligence Committee to cast a ballot against the 2018 authorization act during last month’s vote, said Tuesday his decision was driven by the inclusion of language specifically targeting WikiLeaks, the antisecrecy website responsible for publishing millions of pages’ worth of U.S. state secrets ranging from military documents and diplomatic cables to internal Democratic Party emails. Intelligence Committee Pins A ‘Surveil Me’ Sign On Wikileaks’ Back In Latest Authorization Bill \nPresident Trump seemed to think Wikileaks was a fine establishment while on the campaign trail. As long as Wikileaks kept serving up DNC documents, it could do nothing wrong. Since his election, however, things have changed. The administration is plagued by leaks. Even though Wikileaks hasn’t played a part in those leaks, it has continued to dump CIA documents — something the White House isn’t thrilled with. \nBack in April, the new DOJ — under the leadership of 80s throwback AG Sessions — announced it had prepared charges to arrest Julian Assange. This was something Obama’s administration talked about, but never actually got around to doing. Pursuing Assange and Wikileaks for publishing leaked documents would set a dangerous precedent, paving the way for domestic prosecutions of news agencies. \nFortunately, nothing has moved forward on that front yet. But it appears at least a few Senators would like to further distance Wikileaks from any definition of journalism. As Spencer Ackerman reports for The Daily Beast, the Senate Intelligence Community wants to redefine Wikileaks as a hostile entity. Environment/Energy/Wildlife/Nature Rick Perry’s “baseload” study released, offers a lifeline to coal, nuclear \nThe US Department of Energy (DOE) released a report late Wednesday night recommending that power markets revise how they value coal and nuclear power. The report also admits that low natural gas prices are a primary cause of recent coal plant closures. Analysis of 187 documents concludes Exxon “misled the public” on climate change \nThe documents included internal papers published by journalists at InsideClimate News as well as 50 “peer-reviewed articles on climate research and related policy analysis” written by ExxonMobil researchers. The oil and gas company made the internal papers public and challenged anyone to “read all of these documents and make up your own mind,” accusing journalists of cherry-picking data. \nGeoffrey Supran and Naomi Oreskes, from Harvard’s Department of the History of Science, took up that challenge, comparing the information in the documents cited by ExxonMobil against the information conveyed in the publicly-available advertorial columns published by the company on anthropogenic (or human-caused) climate change in the New York Times. They found that “83 percent of peer-reviewed papers and 80 percent of internal documents acknowledge that climate change is real and human-caused, yet only 12 percent of advertorials do so, with 81 percent instead expressing doubt.” Finance FTC: We won’t stand in the way of pending Amazon-Whole Foods merger \nThe Federal Trade Commission has formally allowed Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods to go forward. \nAccording to a statement released Wednesday by acting FTC director Bruce Hoffman, “Based on our investigation, we have decided not to pursue this matter further. Of course, the FTC always has the ability to investigate anticompetitive conduct should such action be warranted.” \nLast month, there had been some public opposition to the deal. Back in June, the online retail giant announced it would acquire Whole Foods Market for approximately $13.7 billion. The government’s new Brexit position paper is actually pretty good \nToday’s Brexit position paper on enforcement and dispute resolution is a good piece of work. It makes reasonable demands and puts to bed a lot of the crazier hard Brexit rhetoric from No.10. It also has one central argument, which is that the European Court of Justice (ECJ) is not a suitable body to arbitrate on whatever new arrangement the UK and the EU strike up. As it happens, they are correct on both counts – the hard Brexiters are wrong and so is Brussels. \nThe hard Brexiters want May to abide by her promise last autumn to remove Britain completely from ECJ jurisdiction. This was the exact moment it was clear she was a lunatic, reading scraps of paper her aides wrote without thinking and using them as the basis for the country’s future prosperity. It was an amazingly stupid thing for her to have said. The drawbacks became clear almost instantly, when the government confirmed its involvement in a new EU patent court which would have an umbilical cord to the ECJ. Suddenly, years of work and income were at risk. Later, it became clear that our entire nuclear regulation system, under Euratom, had been put in jeopardy due to this commitment. Jeremy Corbyn’s living wage plan ‘would give one in four British workers a pay rise’ \nJeremy Corbyn’s £10-an-hour living wage plan would give one in four British workers a pay rise, new analysis from his party claims. \nAround 40 per cent of those in employment would benefit from Labour’s plan in some parts of the UK, it said, with warnings the Conservatives had not done enough to boost pay. \nThe Government said 1.7 million workers had benefited from the latest rise in the living wage in April, which saw an increase from £7.20 to £7.50. Manufacturing Giant Midea Wants to Put Bitcoin Miners in Household Appliances \nMidea Group, a major manufacturer of electrical appliances in China, is seeking to patent a method for mining bitcoin with household items, public records show. \nThe previously unreported application was submitted last November and published earlier this year by the State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO) of the People’s Republic of China. \nThe company’s application calls for appliances ranging from air conditioners, dehumidifiers and TVs to be built with specialized mining chips embedded inside. Once programmed, the products would connect to a cloud-based service and contribute their hashing power in the background. Republicans try comparing tax code to Legend of Zelda, mix up their facts \nAmerican Republican legislators have begun aiming their sights on a major policy initiative: the nation’s tax code. Any changes will certainly impact the American technology sector, but before getting to that possible impact, there’s the matter of the GOP’s publicity campaign on the matter. \nOn Wednesday afternoon, the GOP showed that it could use some help in its attempts to make its sales pitch look “hip.” AstroTurf/Lobbying/Politics 7 Rules For Reading Trump’s Approval Rating \nIt still isn’t entirely clear how much President Trump’s reaction to the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia — which was criticized by both Democratic and Republican lawmakers after he blamed “many sides” for the violence there — has affected his job approval rating. As of Wednesday evening, Trump’s approval rating was 36.9 percent, according to the FiveThirtyEight average, down only slightly from 37.6 percent on the day before1 a counter-protester and two police officers were killed in Charlottesville. His disapproval rating was 56.8 percent, up only slightly from 56.3 percent before Charlottesville. So perhaps there’s been a little movement — but there hasn’t been the sort of unambiguous decline in Trump’s approval rating that occurred at earlier moments in his presidency, such as when Republicans began to debate their health care bill in March or after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey in May. \nApproval ratings, of course, aren’t the only way to judge a president’s standing. The fact that Republicans in Congress have become much more openly defiant of Trump could spell trouble for him later on, whether or not rank-and-file voters were all that moved by Charlottesville. Nonetheless, approval ratings provide a reality check of sorts, as the media’s guesses about what will or won’t affect public opinion aren’t always accurate. So let me walk you through a few propositions for what I think we’ve learned about Trump’s approval through the first seven months of his presidency — and why his approval ratings’ modest response to Charlottesville shouldn’t have been all that surprising. State Dept. science envoy resigns with letter that spells out ‘Impeach’ \nThe science envoy for the State Department has resigned following President Trump’s response to the violent clashes at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va. \nDaniel Kammen announced his resignation in a letter addressed to Trump — in which the first letter of every paragraph spelled out “Impeach.” \n“My decision to resign is in response to your attacks on core values of the United States,” Kammen said in the letter. \n“Your failure to condemn white supremacists and neo-Nazis has domestic and international ramifications.” MSNBC’s Donny Deutsch: Trump possesses traits of a sociopath \nMSNBC’s Donny Deutsch on Wednesday read traits of a sociopath on air, arguing that President Trump exhibits many of the same qualities. \n“What a sociopath is a condition that prevents people from adopting to ethical and behavioral standards of community,” Deutsch said on MSNBC’s “Deadline: White House,” reading from a paper. \n“Sociopaths are usually extremely charming and charismatic. Sociopaths oftentimes feel entitled to certain positions, people and things. They believe their own beliefs and opinions are the absolute authority and disregard others.” Hillary Clinton: My “skin crawled” when Trump stood behind me \nMSNBC’s Morning Joe has the first batch of excerpts from “What Happened,” Hillary Clinton’s forthcoming memoir on the 2016 presidential election, which feature her reflecting why she wrote the book and on President Trump’s intimidation tactics that made her “skin [crawl]” during their second, town hall-style debate. Fact check: At Phoenix rally, Trump revises history, exaggerates accomplishments and makes false claims \nPresident Trump delivered a raucous, error-filled speech in Arizona on Aug. 22, just days after he was uniformly criticized for blaming “both sides” for the deadly violence at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va. \nThe president gave a revisionist account of his remarks about Charlottesville, exaggerated his accomplishments, and made a series of false and misleading claims: \n• Trump cherry-picked excerpts from his past statements about Charlottesville to put a positive spin on his remarks. But in his retelling, Trump failed to say he blamed “both sides” for the violence that left one counterprotester dead and 19 others injured. \n• Trump also wrongly suggested that the media didn’t report that he had said “racism is evil,” a quote from his second statement — on Monday, Aug. 14 — on the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville. That quote was widely reported by the media.",

      "text": "Home » Featured » UK Police Fail to Identify Bitcoin, Research Group Claims UK Police Fail to Identify Bitcoin, Research Group Claims Posted by: C. Aliens August 26, 2017 in Featured , News Updates Leave a comment \nThe N8 Policing Research Partnership , in early August, published a report that called for an increased law enforcement involvement in bitcoin seizures. The research group, hereinafter “N8,” proposed that UK police needed cryptocurrency training for several reasons. The most significant, they explained, involved the role Bitcoin had on modern criminal activity. According to their report, Bitcoin had become the most popular cryptocurrency among criminals. \nThe report insightfully explained that Bitcoin had become one of the most common method of exchange for crimes involving ransomware or illegal darknet activity. The report failed to clarify whether or not other cryptocurrencies were favored for legal darknet purchases. These currencies—bitcoin & monero received special notices—have been enabling “criminal transactions and crimes such as money laundering, extortion, (ransomware), blackmail, and fraud ,” the report explained. \nVarious scenarios were analyzed before N8 came to conclusions regarding the currency. The report consisted of two types of research. One involved these “scenarios” and the other involved an examination of potential criminal uses of any modern cryptocurrency. One scenario, for instance, included an “actual forensic examination of criminal activity” and “sample purchases of criminal goods from the dark web .” \nSaid scenario was aptly titled “Dark Web Purchases” and, as explained, involved sample purchases from a fictitious darknet marketplace with the added touch of a mock warrant. “As part of this research, dark web marketplaces were accessed and a number of goods were purchased using crypto-currencies bitcoin & monero ,” the report explained. “A mock warrant was executed and devices seized; Dr Syed Naqvi of Birmingham City University then conducted digital forensic examinations to identify bitcoin activity.” \nAnother area of the report highlighted the dynamic between law enforcement officers, ordinary cash seizures, and Bitcoin seizures. According to the group’s research, officers are less likely to identify “Bitcoin activity” than notice and seize cash in an ordinary drug bust. Police in the UK apparently know what physical cash is, but this is not the case with Bitcoin. N8 wants this to change. One approach is through a four page “booklet” on Bitcoin titled, “Booklet Designed To Help Officers To Identify Bitcoin Activity.” \nThe booklet was justified due to the following, N8 wrote: \n“ Officers regularly seize cash from criminals utilising POCA and PACE legislation however the seizure of bitcoin remains a rarity and this is anecdotally, due to officers not knowing A., what bitcoin is , and B., what to look for .” \n“ Subsequently Phil Larratt and Paul Taylor from GMP have produced a four page booklet designed to help officers to identify bitcoin activity .” \nAnd finally, the report suggested—rather recommended—a four tier training program to increase law enforcement’s ability to identify cryptocurrency. \nTier 1 – Bitcoin experts : \nSummarized in the Tier title itself. This tier calls for formalized expert witnesses. \nTier 2 – National/Regional Cyber-Crime Units: \nOfficers of Cybercrime units need to be capable of analyzing Bitcoin transactions. They need access to private industry software. And they need the skill to conduct investigations. \nTier 3 – Digital Media Investigator network: DMIs would be required to use open source tools “to identify and track bitcoin activity.” \nTier 4 – Frontline officers and investigators: \nThis calls for a mandatory “I know what Bitcoin is” course for all UK police. The course would focus on the indemnification of Bitcoin and how to contact the concerned authorities. ",

      "text": "world''s first Bitcoin hedge fund, is once again shaking up the investmentindustry. Today the Malta-headquartered company launched a dedicated altcoinindex, XAI, which reflects the dynamics of the altcoin world (allcryptocurrencies minus Bitcoin). The XAI-Fund, which is available to EXANTEclients immediately, follows the index, to profit from the rise in prices ofmost altcoins in an easy safe and regulated way. The XAI index is made up ofnearly all available popular alternative cryptocurrencies.Anatoliy Knyazev, co-founder of EXANTE elaborated: ''Just a couple of weeks agowe launched separate funds for Ripple, Ethereum. Monero, Zcash and Litecoin -which was a huge success. We did notice an additional demand from clients whodon''t have the time or the technological means to deep-dive and analyze eachcurrency separately - but do want to profit from the bullish altcoin markets.XAI is the solution to that problem.''EXANTE clients can trade XAI fund shares are regular exchange traded instrumentsand they are accessible via the general trading platform. This platform givestraders direct access to more than 50 thousand financial products and nearly allfinancial markets. Trading in these products, is regulated by the MFSA andaudited by KPMG, adding a layer of security normally missing from theunregulated cryptocurrency market.Besides the aforementioned altcoins, the XAI-index also tracks Ethereum Classic.''We decided to leave out Bitcoin,'' said Knyazev, ''since it has less fat left onits bone. Ripple and Monero, for example, nearly doubled in value recently.That''s what makes investing in the XAI fund so interesting and exciting.'' -END-",

The bitcoin price experienced a slight uptick following the SegWit deployment, stabilizing its single-day performance. The wider markets saw a minor pullback from Wednesday’s record $154 billion , but several altcoins–including litecoin, managed to press forward. Chart from CoinMarketCap \nFor most of August 23, the crypto market cap hovered between $150 billion and $155 billion. However, Wednesday evening it dipped to $148 billion. It recovered early Thursday morning, and the total value of all cryptocurrencies currently sits at $151.8 billion. Chart from CoinMarketCap Bitcoin Price Stable Following SegWit Activation \nThe bitcoin price did not see an immediate bump upon SegWit activation, but it did more or less retain its midweek rally. For the day, the bitcoin price declined a bit less than 1% and currently rests at $4,181. This gives bitcoin a market cap of $69 billion. Bitcoin Price Chart from CoinMarketCap \nMany analysts anticipate that SegWit will cause the bitcoin price to punch through $5,000 by the end of the year, while stock researcher Ronnie Moas forecasts it could rise as far as $7,500. However, the future of the bitcoin price will depend on how the community grapples with the increasingly-heated debates over the November SegWit2x hard fork. Ethereum Price Holds at $320 \nThe ethereum price declined about one-half of a percent on Thursday, holding above $320 as the Metropolis hard fork approaches. At present, the ethereum price is $321, which results in a $30.2 billion market cap. Ethereum Price Chart from CoinMarketCap \nThe Metropolis protocol upgrade is highly-anticipated among the community, and many expect the ethereum price to break above $350 as it nears. Bitcoin Cash Price Spikes Near $700 \nThe bitcoin cash price spiked as high as $697 Thursday morning, as another difficulty adjustment enabled BCH mining profitability to reach parity with the main bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin cash is currently about 15% more profitable to mine than bitcoin, and the bitcoin cash hashrate has gradually increased since the adjustment. Chart from Coin Dance \nHowever, the bitcoin cash price was unable to pierce $700, and it quickly fell back to the ~$660 level. At present, the bitcoin cash price is $657, representing a 24-hour decrease of a little more than 1%. Bitcoin Cash Price Chart from CoinMarketCap \nBitcoin cash maintains a market cap of $10.9 billion to remain in 3rd place on the charts. Ripple Price Falters; Litecoin Soars \nThe altcoin markets were mixed on Thursday, although the majority of coins slid into the red. Leading the retreat was the Ripple price, which stumbled following a multi-day rally that returned single-day gains exceeding 50%. Altcoin Price Chart from CoinMarketCap \nThe litecoin price swam against the current to become the only top 5 coin to experience positive movement. After a 9% rise, the litecoin price is now $52; this raised the LTC market cap to $2.7 billion. Litecoin Price Chart from CoinMarketCap \nSixth-ranked IOTA, on the other hand, saw its price plunge by 8%. NEM and Dash held steady at their previous levels, while the NEO price broke out of its early week slump with a 9% rally to bring its market cap above $2 billion. This means that the top nine cryptocurrencies all have market caps exceeding that threshold. \nThe ethereum classic price declined about 1% to round out the top 10, and the markets dealt the Monero price a 10% blow after carrying it to an all-time high a few days ago. \nFeatured image from Shutterstock.",

      "text": "\nFacebook Why Monero? Secure: Using the power of a distributed peer-to-peer consensus network every transaction is cryptographically secured. Individual accounts have a 25 word mnemonic seed displayed when created, and can be written down to backup the account . Account files are encrypted with a passphrase to ensure they are useless if stolen. Private: Monero uses a cryptographically sound system to allow you to send and receive funds without your transactions being easily revealed on the blockchain (the distributed ledger of transactions). This ensures that your purchases, receipts, and all transfers remain absolutely private by default. Untraceable: By taking advantage of ring signatures , a special property of certain types of cryptography, Monero is able to ensure that transactions are not only untraceable, but have an optional measure of ambiguity that ensures that transactions cannot easily be tied back to an individual user or computer.

Standpoint Founder: Bitcoin Asset Class Will Grow Into $2 Trillion Market \nForget $5,000. \nAt a time when many are making short-term bets on the price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, one bitcoin bull is going a step further. Ronnie Moas, founder of Standpoint Research, is making the case cryptocurrencies will not only be a decade-long trend, but a viable asset class. \nIn fact, he’s going so far as to call for a massive rise in the market cap of cryptocurrencies. His prediction? The total value of all cryptographic assets, today valued at $150 billion , will soar to $2 trillion over the next 10 years. \nAnd in a new interview, Moas walked CoinDesk through his forecast, explaining how it stems from his fundamental analysis of the capital markets and the broader macroeconomic trends he now sees in place. \nThe Standpoint founder’s view stands in stark contrast to the highly bearish analysis of Peter Schiff, who called cryptocurrency a bubble, a speculative frenzy and a natural Ponzi scheme driven by “just plain greed” last week. \nIn the broadest sense, Moas sees the current state of the cryptocurrency market as a direct parallel to Silicon Valley during the 1990s, when a massive surge of innovation created new technologies that transformed the way we work and live and ushered in a period of massive wealth creation. \nHe explained: \n“I am not any more concerned with bitcoin being at a record high than Amazon or Google investors were concerned when those share prices jumped hundreds of percent and hit $100 and $200 many years ago. Today, both of those stocks are above $900. The question is not where we are at – it is where are we going? I do not think we are in a bubble.” Roadmap to $2 trillion \nHow does Moas get to the $2 trillion market cap for cryptocurrency in his forecast? \nHe begins by looking at the $200 trillion that is currently invested in global capital markets today, including all major asset classes: cash, stocks, bonds and gold. Moas, who also does traditional equity analysis, begins his market breakdown with stocks, which he believes are currently overvalued. \nAccording to Moas, three-quarters of the names in the S&P 500 are trading at least 18 times earnings, which is higher than his value threshold of 12 times earnings. He also adds that we haven’t had a stock market correction in 20 months. \nOn the currency front, the U.S. dollar is currently losing 1 to 2 percent per year due to inflation. Moas also points out that the dollar has lost half its value since he was in high school 35 years ago. \nFrom a global perspective, where most people don’t have access to U.S. dollars, Moas believes the case for cryptocurrency is even more compelling: \n“Now, imagine what they think of their own local currencies elsewhere in the world. Imagine you live in Venezuela and you’re keeping your money under the mattress. Would you rather leave it there in Venezuelan bolivar or would you rather put it in bitcoin? It’s not going to take you very long to make that decision.” \nBreaking his thesis down further, Moas believes that a conservative estimate is that at least 1 percent of the $200 trillion now tied up in stocks, cash, gold and bonds will migrate into cryptocurrencies over the next decade. \nIn that case, he says, “Bitcoin could end up with a market capitalization that is more than Amazon and Apple combined.” \nUnder this scenario, that would mean that the current market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies would naturally grow. \nAnd if Moas’s market capitalization targets are correct, investors would then receive a 1,250 percent return on their cryptocurrency investments made today. Diversified strategy \nBut he adds one major caveat to that prediction. Simply, “You’ve got to be in the right names.” \nAssuming you accept Moas’s basic bull market thesis for cryptocurrencies, how do you know if you are invested in the right “names” in the cryptocurrency space? And, if the market boom in cryptocurrency is analogous to the roaring years of the 1990s tech boom, how can you avoid investing in the next Pets.com? \nAs Moas frames it: \n“A lot of people say there is a bubble out there. I see a bubble when you get down below the top 50 cryptocurrencies. There are more than 800 names right now. In my view, what happens outside the top 50 is irrelevant.” \nMoas goes on to point out that 91 percent of the nearly $150 billion market cap is invested in the top 20 names and 70 percent is invested in bitcoin and ether alone. \nHe recommends, for the purposes of portfolio diversification, retail investors should hedge their bets and invest across the top 10 or 20 cryptocurrencies. \nIn Moas’s view, the 800 cryptocurrencies that are now trading are analogous to the 800 stocks that were available on the Nasdaq at the height of the dot-com bubble nearly 20 years ago. While Amazon and Apple and Microsoft emerged to become among the most valuable companies of all time, there were many companies from that time period that died slow and painful deaths. \nOr, as Moas more colorfully puts it: “Back then, there were hundreds of pump-and-dump, small-cap junk names just as there are in crypto today. Today, the crypto market is giving you the same signals with names like dash, ripple, litecoin, monero, bitcoin, ethereum , neo, nem, iota and others.” \nHe went on to add that while there are certainly risks involved in investing in cryptocurrency, those risks are, in his view, outweighed by the possibility of 10-to-one or 20-to-one payout to the upside experienced by tech stocks. The bull case \nOf all the major cryptocurrencies, though, Moas seems especially bullish in his view of bitcoin. Unless there is a major shakeup in the underlying confidence, he believes that investors are going to want to buy-and-hold for their portfolios for 10 years or more. \nMoas points out that there are currently only about 16 million bitcoins that have been issued of a possible total 21 million coins that will be created. \nIn his analysis, this could lead to tens of millions of people trying to get their hands on just a few million coins. \nWhen asked for a specific price target, Moas summed up as follows: \n“At the beginning of July, bitcoin was trading at $2,500. I believe in the next three years you will probably see $15,000 to $20,000 for bitcoin. It could double twice from here in the next 36 months.” \nRonnie Moas image via CNBC /Youtube ",

New cryptocurrency bitcoin cash is down 2 percent, however, with prices at $642.95 at press time. \nA notable strong showing for privacy-oriented cryptocurrency monero today sees its price up over 14 percent, with one token now worth $98. \nReflecting continued positivity in the digital asset markets, the market capitalization across all cryptocurrencies is once again at a record high, at just over $155 billion . \nTrader and chart image via Shutterstock   is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies .

      "title": "Estonia, the estcoins and the future of the crypto money — Steemit",
      "text": "Estonia, the estcoins and the future of the crypto money 4 hours ago 49 in bitcoin \nWhile writing these lines, a bitcoin is worth a whopping $ 4,235. It is not a physical currency, but a digital one; But serves to pay in the same way that euros, rubles or yuan are used. The main difference: that the second is controlled by a state and the first, an algorithm. \nAlthough there are many crypto-currencies in the world (Ethereum, ZCash, Monero, Bitcoin Cash, etcetera) nobody or almost nobody has heard of estcoins yet. At the moment they only exist on paper, but Kaspar Korjus, the director of the Estonian e-Residency program, already imagines them on the horizon. Vitalik Butarin, the creator of cryptodivisa Ethereum, has already shown his support. \nIn 2014, Estonia became the first country in the world to allow non-Estonian citizens access to payment processing services, financial institutions, banks and certain companies in the former Soviet republic. The e-residents also receive a smart card with a chip to sign internet transactions with digital certificate. He was baptized e-Residency and is part of a plan that the Estonian administration started in 2003 with the aim of connecting all its government services on the Internet. \nThe 1.3 million Estonians who reside in the country accepted. In order to reduce bureaucracy, the principle of \"only once\" was introduced, whereby the state can not request the same information from citizens twice and that the European Union adopted earlier this year. Anti-fraud measures were also introduced, such as an API distributed to Government and companies to automatically record all bookkeeping and other less popular ones, such as using Big Data to control those transactions. \nWhat are and what would estcoins do? \n\"Investing in any crypto-value can bring big risks and benefits, but the owners of the estcoins would have the added incentive to be supporting the development of our digital nation,\" says Korjus in Medium. The CryptoDivisa would be launched through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) or what is the same, a system to raise funds and carry out the project. \n\"Estonia is calling it virtual currency but more than that, it's a token,\" explains Pablo Fernández Burgueño, Blockchain specialist lawyer and partner at Nev Trace. The main difference is that while a bitcoin or an ether can be mined by anyone from home, a token does not. \nThe cryptomoneda specialist puts an easy-to-understand example: \"Tokens are like the corticoles of El Corte Inglés: numbers created by a company or an institution controlled by itself.\" Tokens, when working with blockchain technology, automatically record the origin and destination of the transactions. By putting Estcoins in circulation in the chain of blocks, Estonia could thus control the transfers between its citizens and the e-residents. \nIn October of 2015, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) considered the bitcoin and the rest of crypto-currencies \"virtual currency\". However, could it prohibit a member state from manufacturing its own currency? \"The most appropriate question would be whether the European Commission (EC) or Parliament could issue a rule or a regulation that would prohibit states from creating their own currency, and of course they can do so, but I do not think it is right or Today, \"says Fernandez Burgueño. \nIn Spain, espcoins, or maybe not \nSpain, which adopted anti-fraud measures in 2013 along with Estonia, Belgium or Romania, \"would also have the ability to do something like this, but not in the short term,\" the lawyer continues. \nFernández Burgueño has asked the Bank of Spain if \"they are going to take some kind of report or something similar that allows Spanish and international companies to have more confidence in the Spanish monetary system.\" And the answer has been that, for the moment, no: \"Spain will not do anything until other EU countries do,\" he says. \nA bitcoin cash is worth $ 618. An Ether (the unit of the Cryptomoneda Ethereum) is $ 319. One unit of ZCash equals $ 228. And so on. Are we at the dawn of a financial revolution? Can we think that, in the future, the traditional currencies disappear by the criptomonedas? \"We can not only think that this may come to exist, but we can be sure that it will be so,\" says the lawyer. \n\"The system is already changing but that change is going to be very slow,\" he continues. Among the reasons for this slow change, Fernández Burgueño enumerates the \"ignorance on the part of the population\", the \"great difficulty of use\" and \"the most obvious: that the different states are very slow in making changes, especially in systems Financial and monetary \". \nEstonia could become the precedent that goes around the entire financial system and make us rethink the way we use and store money, but to change \"round minerals\" [as Fernández Burgueño calls coins] by crypto-currencies there will still be What to expect. \"I would not expect any kind of revolution at the state level in Spain until about 20 or 30 years,\" he said. \nResteem and Upvote please!

This means that you are responsible for your money, and don't have to trust any entity to keep it safe for you. \nMonero is private. \nThe power of the blockchain usually increases security at the cost of privacy, but with Monero's sophisticated privacy-centric technology, you get all of the security benefits of the blockchain without any of the privacy trade-offs. \nMonero is untraceable. \nBy taking advantage of ring signatures, Monero makes it ambiguous which funds have been spent, and thus extremely unlikely that a transaction could be linked to particular user. \nMonero is fungible. \nBecause of the on-by-default nature of the privacy technologies, Monero is fungible, meaning one Monero will always be equal to another. This means you won't have to worry about Monero blacklisted by exchanges or vendors. Rules Breaking the rules gets your post deleted and may result in a ban.

      "text": "IRS Uses Chainalysis to Track Down Bitcoin Tax Cheats IRS Uses Chainalysis to Track Down Bitcoin Tax Cheats August 23, 2017 0 The IRS is actively seeking out tax evaders using Bitcoin, employing tools like Chainalysis to unmask them. Many people believe that Bitcoin is anonymous , but it is in fact pseudonymous. All transactions linked to a particular address are visible on the Blockchain, which is public and transparent. However, it is not possible to link a particular wallet address to the real world identity of a person/company without any additional information. While good privacy practices can prevent leakage of information, there is always a point where Bitcoin transactions touch the traditional monetary system (when you use it in a store or when you sell it at an exchange) and proof of identity can become necessary. Working backwards, it is possible to unravel the chain of Bitcoin transactions to some extent. IRS and Chainalysis The IRS has been trying hard to obtain details about Bitcoin transactions and detect cases of tax evasion. The IRS had previously requested Coinbase to give it details about its users for the period 2013-15. As per a document referenced by Daily Beast, the IRS has also awarded a contract to Chainalysis to analyse transactions and unmask users. Chainalysis uses data scraped from public forums, leaked data sources including dark web, exchange deposits and withdrawals to tag and identify transactions. The IRS expects to use this data to catch tax cheats as well as criminals who sell drugs and other illegal goods and services for Bitcoin. Does Chainalysis work? There have been Bitcoin mixing services which specialized in obfuscating the source of Bitcoins. Bitmixer.io was the leader amongst mixing services, before it announced its decision to mysteriously shut down. Coinjoin transactions also make it difficult to trivially link Bitcoin transactions. Services like Joinmixer help like-minded individuals combine transactions to enhance privacy. Moreover, while Chainalysis claims that it has information on a high percentage of Bitcoin addresses (25 percent), it is possible that these could be addresses with poor privacy practices. Chainalysis may not be able to unmask transactions where users have intentionally tried to obfuscate the transaction trail. What about altcoins? While the IRS may be breaking its head in trying to unmask those behind Bitcoin transactions, its efforts will be futile if extended to the wider cryptocurrency space. Certain currencies like Dash , Monero and ZCash have inbuilt privacy features, which makes it difficult to track transactions. If people shift from Bitcoin to secondary currencies like these, the IRS would have its hands full when trying to detect specific cases of tax evasion. Moreover, the resources that it would take to investigate these currencies would make the whole exercise infeasible. It is possible that a simple and clear tax regime with respect to cryptocurrencies may be what is required to gain higher compliance with respect to tax in cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies are currently in a gray area and this may prevent people from fully disclosing their cryptocurrency holdings to tax authorities. FIRE... ",

      "text": "Nachrichtenquelle: GlobeNewswire | 24.08.2017, 10:00 | 80 | 0 | 0 EXANTE, the European fintech firm that made history in 2012 by launching the world's first Bitcoin hedge fund, is once again shaking up the investment industry. Today the Malta-headquartered company launched a dedicated altcoin index, XAI, which reflects the dynamics of the altcoin world (all cryptocurrencies minus Bitcoin). The XAI-Fund, which is available to EXANTE clients immediately, follows the index, to profit from the rise in prices of most altcoins in an easy safe and regulated way. The XAI index is made up of nearly all available popular alternative cryptocurrencies. Anatoliy Knyazev, co-founder of EXANTE elaborated: 'Just a couple of weeks ago we launched separate funds for Ripple, Ethereum. Monero, Zcash and Litecoin - which was a huge success. We did notice an additional demand from clients who don't have the time or the technological means to deep-dive and analyze each currency separately - but do want to profit from the bullish altcoin markets. XAI is the solution to that problem.' EXANTE clients can trade XAI fund shares are regular exchange traded instruments and they are accessible via the general trading platform. This platform gives traders direct access to more than 50 thousand financial products and nearly all financial markets. Trading in these products, is regulated by the MFSA and audited by KPMG, adding a layer of security normally missing from the unregulated cryptocurrency market. Besides the aforementioned altcoins, the XAI-index also tracks Ethereum Classic. 'We decided to leave out Bitcoin,' said Knyazev, 'since it has less fat left on its bone. Ripple and Monero, for example, nearly doubled in value recently. That's what makes investing in the XAI fund so interesting and exciting.' -END-",

      "text": "\nFacebook Why Monero? Secure: Using the power of a distributed peer-to-peer consensus network every transaction is cryptographically secured. Individual accounts have a 25 word mnemonic seed displayed when created, and can be written down to backup the account . Account files are encrypted with a passphrase to ensure they are useless if stolen. Private: Monero uses a cryptographically sound system to allow you to send and receive funds without your transactions being easily revealed on the blockchain (the distributed ledger of transactions). This ensures that your purchases, receipts, and all transfers remain absolutely private by default. Untraceable: By taking advantage of ring signatures , a special property of certain types of cryptography, Monero is able to ensure that transactions are not only untraceable, but have an optional measure of ambiguity that ensures that transactions cannot easily be tied back to an individual user or computer.

To: Required Needs to be a valid email From: Required Needs to be a valid email Subject: The Price of Ripple Drops 16% After \"Disappointing\" Announcement Message: By Garrett Baldwin , Economist   Website eight × eight = \nThe price of Ripple fell by double digits as traders took profits from the recent rally in the cryptocurrency. \nSome of the selling was also fueled by a \"disappointing\" announcement. Digital currency investors expected Ripple to enter the Chinese market, but that's not what Ripple tweeted about on Aug. 24, 2017. \nThe total market capitalization of the cryptocurrency industry hovered at $155.9 billion. Inside the top 50 cryptocurrencies, Monero added nearly 19%, and Lisk added 16%. \nBut the biggest gainer was Veritaseum, which popped another 31% on the day. Today's largest decliner from that group was BitConnect, which slipped 30.4%. \nBelow is a recap of the top cryptocurrency prices at 12:00 p.m. EDT \nBitcoin: $4,430.56, +4.56% \nNow that we know today's price movements, here's what has been moving these cryptocurrencies… Bitcoin Climbs for Third Straight Day \nThe price of Bitcoin climbed for the third straight trading session and continues to rebound from its short-term low of $3,675 on Aug. 22. \nThe market capitalization of Bitcoin climbed as high as $72 billion, despite concerns that miners have been bouncing back and forth between BTC and its new rival Bitcoin Cash (BCH). \nAccording to various reports, BCH is now 10% to 14% more profitable to mine than Bitcoin. \nTrending: Why the Nero Price Has Soared More Than 37,000 in 2017 Bitcoin Cash Dips as Traders Buy Different Digital Currencies \nBitcoin Cash was declining in price Friday. The downturn comes as South Korean traders have been pouring money into rival cryptocurrencies like Monero, NEO, and Ripple. \nTotal market capitalization hit $10.4 billion, while trading volumes were just $414 million on the day. Ethereum Prices Continue to Climb \nThe Ethereum price continued to follow Bitcoin higher. In a day that has been dominated by the volatility of lesser-known coins, Ethereum has been making a slow and steady climb on lower volume levels. Video Top 5 Cryptocurrencies to Invest in Today Ripple Sell-Off Follows Monster Rally \nRipple was hammered by 16% on Friday thanks to a sell-off from Korean traders. \nAlso, investors were disappointed by an announcement Ripple made on Aug. 24, which was about a conference in October. \nThere were rumors Ripple was going to enter the Chinese market or even work with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (NYSE: BABA ), but details on working with Alibaba or concrete plans to enter China were not revealed. Litecoin Prices Surpass $51.00 per Coin \nThe price of Litecoin continued to climb thanks to two bullish factors that have made it an attractive investment. \nFirst, traders see it as a highly compatible coin to Bitcoin due to the recent implementation of Segregated Witness (SegWit). In addition, many see this as a potential hedge for Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, as both cryptocurrencies flutter near record highs. \nEarlier this week, Tuur Demeester, a prominent analyst and owner of cryptocurrencies, argued that Litecoin would experience a price pop should a sell-off occur in Bitcoin or its new spinoff.",

Weekends sometime can be hectic because it's a time when you want to finish all the pending issues you neglected during the week. Anyway it's also great time relax and unwind, here's an article to help some understand and utilize the tips on cryptocurrencies trade.... Enjoy \nCryptocurrency is taking the world by storm, with most of us being left behind. The majority of the world’s population doesn’t even know what Bitcoin is, let alone how to get in on the action. Just like any other investment or tech startup, you need to do your research. \nHere are the top tips on how you can get started: \n1. Research Every Altcoin You Are Interested In \nEvery cryptocurrency (or at least most of them) has a website dedicated to its altcoin (alternative coin). Not only that, but the more popular coins that have been established for quite some time will have a dedicated Slack for community discussions, Reddit forums full of commentary and a fair amount of news stories written about them. This is the best way to get to know the community, technology and company behind the coin. \nWith the recent bombardment of ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings), investors around the world are investing in every ICO they can because of FOMO (Fear of Missing Out). Unfortunately in some instances, this is giving cryptocurrency a bad name. Some of the companies holding an ICO are taking advantage of the investor community, and some are even going out of business before they build a product. An ICO is basically a way for a cryptocurrency startup to raise money to build their business the way a tech startup raises a seed round or Series A round. All the investors see is a landing page, a list of founders and a white paper (a PDF document that explains the technology behind the platform). Then they make a decision whether or not to invest in the company just based on that. \nThis is why the SEC has recently stepped in to regulate the ICOs. The federal agency is trying to help prevent many newbie investors from losing their shirts. All you have to do to protect your investment is to make sure you are investing in an altcoin that has a community, a team and a technology that is already proven: such as Siacoin. Sia already has customers, revenue, traction and a wonderful community backing not only the technology but the currency as well. Other examples of community-backed altcoins with functional products are Zcash (ZEC), Dash (DASH), Monero(XMR) and there are many more. \n2. Research Market Trends and Analyze Data \nSort of like the stock market, you can research market trends for the volume of altcoins being traded and their market cap. For example, as of this writing, Bitcoin was up to a $72 billion market cap, which is almost higher than PayPal. Every coin has a market cap and a trading volume, and by checking out websites like Coin Market Cap you can see the top coins that are being traded as of right now. Then you can use an indexing site such as CoinCube to automatically invest in the top (20) coins or whatever number you choose. This is a more hands off approach. \n3. Trading Bitcoin For Altcoins On An Exchange \nIf you’d like to control your bids (buys) and asks (sells), after you do your research you can buy and sell whichever coin you prefer through an exchange such as Bittrex. A month ago Antshares (ANS) were just $4 a piece, and after doing research you might have decided it was worth investing some money in them. So you bought 100 of those coins, and since then, ANS has been rebranded as NEOand now they are valued at roughly $42 apiece. By using an exchange like Bittrex, you will be able to send your Bitcoin to a wallet there, and then trade for other altcoins. \nAlways remember the age-old saying: Only invest what you are able to lose, because in this volatile market that goes up-and-down, you may lose everything within seconds. \nThe good news is, cryptocurrency is fairly new, it’s here to stay, and with the advent of Ethereum and smart contracts it seems to be going in the right direction in terms of a decentralized internet. An important trend that is prevalent in cryptocurrency trading is when Bitcoin goes up in value, altcoins tend to go down in value. This is because when Bitcoin goes up in value, traders exchange their altcoins for Bitcoin, and the flood of sales brings the altcoin values down. The opposite is true when Bitcoin goes down in value, altcoin values go up. Being able to move with these trends is important if you are in it for the short term. \nSince Bitcoin is only a currency, it took a while for it to take hold in the market, but with Ethereum, there is a purpose now. With smart contracts you’re able to create a landlord tenant agreement for your rental property along with the exchange of Ether coins for payment. This eliminates the need for a paper contract, back-and-forth emailing and wire transfers or cash and credit card exchanges. In one fell swoop you can not only agree to and sign a contract, but you can pay for it as well. Within the next few years we should see the platforms of these altcoins evolve and transform the world of technology into not only a decentralized internet, but a more secure and useful internet. \nImagine a decentralized cloud storage platform that encrypts and splits up your files into pieces of metadata that are hosted by random nodes (people) around the world. Well, it exists with Sia. The next time Game of Thrones gets leaked online, HBO might think about hosting their videos and screenplays on Sia, since its encrypted network highly resistant to hacking. Other platforms offer different useful functions that will benefit society in the near future. Whether legally binding contracts, anonymous payments, charitable donation systems or cloud storage, deciding on which one of those to invest in is the key to ensuring that your investment gives you a high ROI. \nLastly, if you are unsure about how to even purchase Bitcoin, there are now ATMs in your area where you can put in cash and they will deposit Bitcoin into your wallet. Or you can use websites like Coinbase or Coinmama to purchase Bitcoin with your credit card or bank account. For more experienced technologists, you can build what’s called a mining rig and join a pool of users that contribute to solving complex algorithms. By hashing in these pools, you are rewarded in coins. (Full disclosure: This reporter is currently mining Ether and Siacoin \nMining Rig \nIn order to build a mining rig you need expensive GPUs (Graphics Processing Units, aka video cards) to do the heavy lifting. Most mining rigs cost an average of $2,500 or so to build and cost roughly $30 to $50 worth of electricity to run per month. \nBlockchain or cryptocurrency startups are essentially a new form of tech startups and can almost be treated this way. They normally include a team of entrepreneurs, a problem solving platform, traction and revenue. The best part is that you, the everyday person, can now invest in them simply by purchasing altcoins. Welcome to the wild west of cryptocurrency.

While Bitcoin is now incredibly difficult to mine, it’s relatively easy to buy itcoins with traditional currency. For anyone wanting to begin their foray into this form of peer-to-peer transaction, which offers anonymity while simultaneously cutting out banks and other traditional third party financial entities, the first step is getting a Bitcoin wallet. \nIt is the first decentralized peer-to-peer payment network that is powered by its users with no central authority or middlemen. Bitcoin was the first practical implementation and is currently the most prominent triple entry bookkeeping system in existence. \nHere are the Top 10 Bitcoin Wallets that you need to try right now, \n1. MYCELIUM \nMycellium is one of the best Bitcoin wallets out there. With this app you can easily send and receive Bitcoins using your mobile device. It allows for cold-storage integrations with hardware Bitcoin wallets like Trezor or KeepKey, and has a unique feature to help manage your private keys as well as a secret number that allows Bitcoins to be spent. \n2. COPAY \nEver got confused about private keys? That’s where Copay comes in. This open source, multi-signature wallet from BitPay can help you have greater control over your private keys. This multi-signature technology allows Bitcoin wallets to be controlled by multiple private keys and users. Authorization for each transaction can require one, some, or all of these private keys. \n3. COINBASE \nBy far, Coinbase is one of the most popular Bitcoin exchange services used globally. Merchants and consumers can transact with a variety of digital currencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. \n4. BREADWALLET \nBreadwallet is another open source and user-friendly wallet, perfect for beginners. Their core design principle is easy and intuitive software, so it’s a great option for those just starting out with Bitcoin. \n5. ARMORY \nArmory is the most secure and full-featured solution available for users and institutions to generate and store Bitcoin private keys. This means users never have to trust the Armory team and can use it with the Glacier Protocol. \n6. ELECTRUM \nElectrum is an extremely fast and lightweight Bitcoin wallet. It uses minimal computing resources, so it is a perfect match for older hardware. Electrum proves that being less resource-intensive doesn’t mean having to cut down on features. \n7. AIRBITZ \nIf you’re looking for something that will guarantee a little more privacy then have a look at Airbitz. The unique feature about Airbitz is that it is a completely decentralized wallet. What this means is that neither the company behind it nor any third-party can access your money or data. For those looking for best option in security and anonymity, this may be the wallet for you. \n8. MULTIBIT \nMultiBit HD is the brainchild of KeepKey, a company that manufactures a hardware Bitcoin wallet by the same name. It is a lightweight desktop client which, like Breadwallet, connects directly to the Bitcoin network. This open-source client allows you to backup your wallets using a passphrase, so you can restore your private keys using the backup phrase. \n9. BITCOIN WALLET \nBitcoin Wallet is the first mobile Bitcoin app. Designed to make Bitcoin easy to use at a time when these types of apps were limited, it’s a simple design without all the bells and whistles of newer apps. You can quickly pay by scanning the QR code, which is a big plus. \n10. TREZOR WALLET \nTrezor was one of the earliest pioneers of the hardware wallets. SatoshiLabs, a Europian start-up, is the brainchild behind the Trezor wallet. Moreover, it connects to your computer via USB and features an OLED display.

      "text": "BSP Greenlights Two Bitcoin Exchanges for the Philippines Date: in: Bitcoin 6 Views \nTwo companies operating out of the Philippines have just been given the approval to operate Bitcoin exchanges by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP). The acceptance of two bitcoin exchanges comes only months after BSP recognized two bitcoin companies experiencing $5-6 million a month in volume, compared to just half that in 2016. \nIt was only February 2017 when the BSP issued Circular 944, which laid down the necessary framework for a monumental decision like this to occur in the first place. Sponsored Links \nThe circular states that Bitcoin exchanges act similarly to remittance and transfer companies, they should also be regulated by Republic Act 9160 or the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2001. \nRemittances from oversea workers back home to family in the Philippines is so routine that quite a large portion of the country’s GDP relies on remittances. Sending money over great distances is something that bitcoin excels at, hence the rising popularity in Bitcoin remittance companies. \nWhile naturally, the companies handling the remittance would convert the bitcoin to the Philippine peso, there may be some families looking to forgo a company and transmit bitcoin themselves. \nFollowing this reasoning, it makes sense that exchanges where bitcoin and fiat can be swapped freely, hence the approval of two exchanges. \nThe news was broken at the recent FinTech Thought Leadership Roundtable Series by Governor Nestor Espenilla Jr, where he described the exchanges as being “local based, but they have international roots.” \nSo while the Bitcoin companies are springing up, the BSP wants to set a legal precedent down and get ahead of the ball. \nOn top of circular 944, Espenilla said the BSP is also going to issue IT risk management framework to supplement the basic framework established in Circular 808, originally issued in 2013. \nGovernor Nestor Espenilla Jr also stated: \n“It will have enhanced expectations on cybersecurity risk management, that is one. It will further open up the use cases for cloud technology in banking applications, and the third one it if further strengthen the governance responsibilities of the bank’s boards and management to make sure that the IT systems of their institutions are robust and resilient to cyber crime as well as disasters.” \nWith Bitcoin becoming more and more prevalent at an accelerating pace, governments are having to adapt to keep up with the revolutionary concept of Bitcoin and many of its counterparts such as Ethereum, Litecoin, and Monero to name a few. \nA framework like this may invite further Bitcoin companies to settle in the Philippines, potentially bringing more money into the country.",

The ethereum price was stable at about $335, while bitcoin cash dipped 3% to $626. Ordinarily, this would have led to a minor market contraction, but strong showings from the Monero and Dash prices provided it with the support it needed to maintain its record level. Chart from CoinMarketCap \nThe total cryptocurrency market cap fluctuated throughout the day, but the altcoin markets ultimately gave it a 24-hour boost of $400 million. At present, the total value of all cryptocurrencies is $155 billion. Chart From CoinMarketCap Bitcoin Price Slips Below $4,300 \nThe bitcoin price had risen 4% on Friday, giving investors hope that it would cross $4,500 for the for the first time. That appeared possible early in the day, as the bitcoin price rose past $4,450 heading into the evening. Unfortunately, the bitcoin price began to dip at about 20:00 UTC, and it continued its gradual decline on Saturday. At present, the bitcoin price is $4,284, which translates into a $70.8 billion market cap. Bitcoin Price Chart from CoinMarketCap \nNevertheless, many analysts anticipate the bitcoin price rally will continue in the coming months. Gatecoin CEO Aurelien Menant forecasts that bitcoin will reach $5,000 by the end of the year, while Wall Street strategist Tom Lee predicts it will cross $6,000 by mid-2018. Dash Price Roars to $400 \nThe total crypto market cap owes its stability to the Monero and Dash prices, which have both experienced record-setting rallies in August. Last month, the Dash price was $200. It gradually increased throughout the weeks that followed, eventually punching through $300 on August 20. It hovered around the $300 level for most of the week, but a surge in trading on Bithumb thrust Dash above $400 to set a new all-time high of $409 on Saturday morning. The Dash price has pulled back a bit since then and currently sits at $387. This gives Dash a market cap of $2.9 billion, planting it firmly in 5th place on the market cap charts. Dash Price Chart from CoinMarketCap \nOne factor influencing Dash’s rapid ascent is a potential television sponsorship proposed by RT host Max Keiser. Keiser, a long-time cryptocurrency proponent, offered Dash a full sponsorship for his new show, The Great American Pilgrimage, in exchange for 2,000 Dash ($775,000 at time of writing). Monero Price Climbs Another 45% \nDash was not the only privacy-centric altcoin to soar to climb the charts this week. The Monero price has nearly tripled since Bithumb–the world’s highest-volume cryptocurrency exchange– announced it would add XMR trading pairs. Monero Price Chart from CoinMarketCap \nOn Friday, the Monero price surpassed $100 for the first time, but its rally did not stop there. This morning, the Monero price climbed another 45%, lifting it to a record $146. At present, the Monero price is $140, resulting in a market cap of $2.1 billion. There are now nine cryptocurrencies with market caps exceeding $2 billion. Bitcoin Market Share Tapers to 46% \nYesterday, bitcoin’s share of the total market cap had climbed back to 47% after an early week decline. However, Dash and Monero each took a small bite out of bitcoin’s share, reducing it to 46% on Saturday. Bitcoin Price Chart from CoinMarketCap \nEthereum continues to account for about 20% of the market, while Ripple’s share has tapered to 5.3% after soaring earlier in the week. Dash’s market share is quickly approaching 2%, while Monero’s has risen to 1.4%.",

      "title": "IRS Crackdown; Tracking Bitcoiners with Chainalysis - Bitcoin News",
      "text": "34 IRS Crackdown; Tracking Bitcoiners with Chainalysis \nAccording to a contract recently obtained by the Daily Beast, the IRS can now track bitcoin and other cryptocurrency addresses. They can do this to route out potential tax evaders. They purchased software from the blockchain analysis group Chainalysis . \nAlso read: Nakamoto Institute Daniel Krawisz: “I Don’t Like Altcoins, but I Like Forks” \nThe document details that “criminals” have used digital currencies to launder money, deal drugs, and commit other unlawful behavior. However, criminals have also been using digital currencies to ignore tax liabilities and evade responsibility. The Daily Beast article elaborated: \nThe document highlights how law enforcement isn’t only concerned with criminals accumulating bitcoin from selling drugs or hacking targets, but also those who use the currency to hide wealth or avoid paying taxes. Reason for IRS Crackdown; Tracking Bitcoiners \nThe reason the IRS is cracking down on digital currencies appears to be because only 802 people declared bitcoin profits or losses in 2015. The Daily Beast article suggests that many people may have not expected the IRS to collect on digital currencies. Others may have just thought they could easily sidestep this alleged obligation. \nAs a result of this failure to pay taxes, the IRS consulted with Chainalysis. They are now providing the IRS with tools to track bitcoin addresses through the blockchain and centralized exchanges. A Fortune article captured a screen shot of the letter: \nThe tool that Chainaylsis gave the IRS is called a refactor tool. It visualizes, tracks, and analysis transactions on the blockchain. Agencies from law enforcement, IRS, and banks will be able to use the tool, according to sources. To date, records show the IRS has paid Chainaylsis $88,700 since 2015 for its services. Tax Evaders and “Criminals” are Adapting; Coinbase Case Chainalysis \nEven though the IRS and companies such as Chainalysis are starting to hunt down blockchain users for evading taxes, enterprising individuals are adapting. They are now starting to use blockchains and cryptocurrencies that undermine current analytic techniques. For instance, the Wannacry hacker group supposedly moved their funds over into Monero to evade detection by law enforcement. Other crypto users may decide to use Zcash, which also employs more private and anonymous transaction measures. \nIn the past, the IRS has used multiple outlets to capture tax evaders using bitcoin. They have already tried to legally force Coinbase to hand over customer information. Currently, it looks like Coinbase may surrender customer data for those who exchanged over $20,000 worth of bitcoin on the platform. No telling what the court will rule in the end. News.Bitcoin.com covered the case in June: \nThe IRS will no longer target a wide-range of Coinbase users via its information request, which it filed on Coinbase back in March. Instead, the agency made concessions to seek account data of individuals who transacted — meaning they bought, sold, sent, or received — $20,000 worth of bitcoin in any transaction type. \nDo you think it is necessary for the IRS to track people’s bitcoin? Will the IRS succeed at catching everyone who evades taxes?

      "text": "Eduardo 0 Comments Blockchain , crypto coins , ethereum , Wallet \nBlockchain , the popular Bitcoin wallet, recently announced that it will include support for another crypto-divinity: the platform revealed to Bitcoin.com that Ethereum will be part of its ecosystem. The company is one of the oldest in the industry, having provided more than 16 million wallets in 140 countries. \nNow that the company is adding Ethereum to its platform, users will be able to exchange between BTC and ETH through a partnership with Shapeshift – Exchange operator that supports crypto actives like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero, Zcash, Dogecoin … -. The organization wants customers to explore different crypto coins, while remaining comfortable with the security of the wallets that have their seal. \nPeter Smith, CEO of Blockchain, declares the following: \n“As Ethereum’s popularity has grown, our customers have also increased their desire to manage multiple digital assets in their Blockchain portfolios. We are very happy to introduce this new addition to users, and we will continue to work on finding ways to make interaction with crypto-currencies even easier. “ \nBlockchain believes that multiple integration accounts can be a challenge for consumers, but they claim that panel manipulation on their platform is fairly straightforward. Blockchain’s portfolios have always allowed customers to maintain their own private keys, and the company contends that with the integration of Ethereum the experience will be “a very consistent product with a centralized control panel that features accessible tools for the users”. \nThus, customers will be able to exchange between Bitcoin and Ethereum thanks to the function that will be provided by the Shapeshift API. Since its launch in 2011, Blockchain’s team has focused on usability, simplicity, and security, and with Ethereum’s integration they have minimized changes to the user interface by adding a simple button that allows customers to switch between wallets of BTC and ETH; In addition, it shows the balance of the accounts and there is already a mobile application on the way. \nHaving Ethereum and the partnership with Shapeshift is a very important step of Blockchain within the market, which by the way has already surpassed the $ 140 billion mark according to CoinMarketCap data. Blockchain is starting to support the entire repertoire of digital coins and not just the mother’s crypto coin … including Ethereum is the first major launch since the closing of Blockchain’s latest financing, which reached the mark of $ 40 million thanks to investments Google and billionaire Richard Branson.

This marked another important milestone for privacy-centric Monero, which has been on a year-long bull run that began when the now-defunct darknet market AlphaBay began accepting it as payment in August 2016. 1-Year XMR Price Chart from CoinMarketCap \nLike all coins, XMR has benefited from the general upswing in the markets, but it has also managed to increase its value against bitcoin, its largest trading pair \nOne year ago, the Monero price was just $4.10. It broke $10 in December and had doubled to $20 by March. When the markets began to go wild in April, May, and June, the XMR price punched through $50. The market downturn forced the Monero price down to the mid-$30s in July, but August has brought a resurgence. \nDuring the month’s first three weeks, Monero mostly tracked the wider market movement, rising to $54 on August 21. However, it broke from the pack on August 21, spiking above $90 in less than 24 hours. Bithumb Listing Raises Monero Price to $100 7-Day XMR Price Chart from CoinMarketCap \nThe primary factor influencing this rapid advance was the announcement that Bithumb, the world’s highest-volume cryptocurrency exchange, had decided to list Monero to its platform. This move will enable Monero to break into the lucrative South Korean markets and gives XMR its first KRW trading pair. Advertisement: \nOn August 25, Bithumb began accepting XMR deposits, and the Monero price jumped to a new all-time high of $101. Other Factors \nThe primary factor influencing XMR price movement is the Bithumb listing, but there have been two other factors that could be buttressing the coin’s rally. First, the Hong Kong-based LocalMonero.co launched to provide the community with a peer-to-peer exchange platform similar to LocalBitcoins.com. \nSecond, news broke this week that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service has been contracting with a blockchain analysis firm since 2015 to track and unmask U.S. residents who they believe are not paying taxes on bitcoin-related income or are using bitcoin to hide assets from the government. News like this could drive the privacy-conscious toward anonymity-centric altcoins such as Monero, Dash, and Zcash. \nFeatured image from Shutterstock. ",

      "text": "Neptune Exploit Kit Dropping Cryptocurrency Miners Through Malvertisements August 22, 2017 , 5:51 pm \nThe Zminer executable is being dropped from an exploit kit, which in turn connects with an Amazon S3 storage bucket to grab two payloads called Claymore CryptoNote CPU Miner and Manager.exe. Claymore is the mining utility used to produce Monero, an open-source cryptocurrency that goes to lengths to obfuscate its blockchain, making it a challenge to trace any activity. Manager oversees the mining and includes instructions for the Windows Task Scheduler, said Ashwin Vamshi, a security researcher at Netskope. \n“We typically have observed that after a victim is infected by an exploit kit, for example, Neptune exploit kit, the victim’s machine is driven through these drive-by-download sites,” Vamshi told Threatpost. “At this time we did not find enough evidence of particular sites or category of sites leading to Zminer.” \nOne twist is that Zminer, once it’s up and running on a victim’s machine, seeks out and disables Windows Defender by adding several keys in the system registry. Vamshi said Netskope has not seen any version of Zminer trying to disable other antimalware or host-based intrusion prevention software. \n“On the network side, given that the communication to download the payload is over HTTPS and the interaction with a managed cloud application Amazon AWS, if network-IPS does not have the capability to inspect encrypted channels and understand activity-level transactions of Amazon AWS, they would fail to protect enterprise customers,” Vamshi said. \nEarlier this week, FireEye reported that attackers were using Neptune to spread miners through malvertising . FireEye said the kit has been redirecting victims with popups from fake hiking ads to exploit kit landing pages and in turn to HTML and Adobe Flash exploits. Some sites that convert YouTube videos to MP3s are also implicated in these attacks, all of which redirect to a site hosting a Monero miner download. \nNetskope provided details on two separate operations that have netted 101 Monero, or $8,300 USD, and 44 Zcash, or $10,100 USD so far. Zminer uses Monero on 32-bit Windows systems, and Zcash on 64-bit. \n“Since the mining operation usually involves a lot of computing power, the CPU usage will be extensively dominated by the miner. As a result, the machines or workstations start functioning abnormally slow,” Vamshi said. “We have only observed Zminer disabling Windows Defender and it used no other technique to evade detection of the CPU usage. Users should treat abnormal increase in CPU usage as a potential indicator for coin-mining malware.” \nNetskope, meanwhile, has privately reported to Amazon the S3 URLs hosting the Zminer payloads, and Vamshi said it is awaiting a response. \n“The attacker has chosen Amazon Simple Storage Service as it is easy to deliver the payload and make the victim believe the source is trusted,” Vamshi said. \nIn the meantime, coin mining continues to be a viable revenue-generating option for criminals. Even nation-state attackers from North Korea alleged to be behind May’s WannaCry ransomware outbreak used the NSA’s EternalBlue SMB exploit to spread the Adylkuzz miner . \n“Coin mining allows anyone with access to the internet and suitable hardware to participate in mining and generate money,” Vamshi said. Cryptocurrency currently has a global market cap of $153 billion, and it’s climbing. \n“Of late, we along with the rest of the security industry have seen a growing trend of crypto-mining malware,” Vamshi said. “We can only speculate that there are enough threat actors with a primary focus of generating money treading along this new path may be due to the fact that there is not a lot of money they are able to generate via ransomware.”",

      "text": "Bitcoin Nears All-Time High As $5,000 Target ‘Back in Play’ Bitcoin has appreciated to almost $4,400 as recent declines reverse and commentators become more bullish on $5,000. 11983 Total views 490 Total shares when moon Bitcoin (BTC) has once again exited above $4,000 in a move Tone Vays says puts $5,000 levels “back in play.” Having dipped as low as $3,674, Bitcoin has rebounded in recent days to circle all-time highs from earlier this month. Cross-exchange data from Coinmarketcap shows BTC trading around $4,360, having peaked at $4,390 earlier Friday. Compiling the latest of his price chart analyses, Vays concluded current data “screams buy,” adding that $5,000 for BTC was once again a potential scenario. #Bitcoin Daily & Weekly look ridiculously bullish, no fear of #BCash or #NO2X getting in $BTCUSD 's way... Charts scream BUY!!! pic.twitter.com/zFf9ziSDYa — Tone Vays [#NO2X] (@ToneVays) August 24, 2017 In contrast to comments by Chain architect Oleg Andreev this week, Vays added the effects of the one extant and one potential Bitcoin fork were not hampering BTC’s price. His joins the similarly bullish prognoses from Max Keiser, who has revised his “interim” price forecast from $5,000 to $10,000 per Bitcoin. Meanwhile, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) extends its near week-long decline from highs of almost $900, continuing to markedly exceed BTC’s volatility. \nAcross the top 15 cryptocurrencies, Monero continues to gain versus USD, riding on the back of hugely increased trading interest resulting from South Korean exchange Bithumb’s move to add it to its books.

      "title": "Is Bitcoin Really Anonymous? IRS Moves to Track Cryptocurrencies With New Chain Analysis Tools | Gold and Precious Metals",
      "text": "(Before It's News)\nAuthored by Mac Slavo via SHTFplan.com,\nLast month Alt-Market.com founder Brandon Smith warned that Bitcoin may not be all that it’s cracked up to be in terms of its purported anonymity :\nFor years, one of the major original selling points of bitcoin was that it was “ anonymous .” It always surprised me that so many people in the liberty movement bought into this scam.\nSurely after the revelations exposed by Edward Snowden and organizations like Wikileaks, it is utterly foolish to believe that anything in the digital world is truly “anonymous.”\nThe feds have been proving there is no anonymity , even in bitcoin, for some time, as multiple arrests using bitcoin tracking have indeed occurred when the FBI decided it was in their interest. Meaning, when the feds want to track bitcoin transactions , they can, and it does not matter how well the people involved covered their actions.\nBecause every transaction exists on a public blockchain ledger, an enterprising organization – say like the NSA or IRS – could conceivably implement blockchain analysis tools to track down Bitcoin fund transfers around the globe. These days most bitcoin transactions are originated on “trusted” exchanges that exist in Western nations, where governments have always found new and innovative ways to ensure citizens have no privacy whatsoever, especially when it comes to personal finances. This means that there is more than likely a record of your original Bitcoin transaction, perhaps involving a credit card or bank transfer, and if regulators ask an exchange to turn over the information you can bet they’ll do so in order to avoid unwanted government scrutiny. Moreover, most exchanges now require a driver’s license, passport and even a phone number in order to approve your account for trading.\nThe point is, for government investigators with a bone to pick, your crypto currency activities online may not be as anonymous and private as you may think.\nIn fact, so exposed is the blockchain to Big Brother monitoring and interference, that the Internal Revenue Service has now implemented blockchain analysis tools to help them track down individuals who are profiting off the crypto currency and not declaring these profits on their tax returns.\nVia Bitcoin.com :\nAccording to a contract recently obtained by the Daily Beast, the IRS can now track bitcoin and other cryptocurrency addresses. They can do this to route out potential tax evaders. They purchased software from the blockchain analysis group Chainalysis .\nThe document details that “criminals” have used digital currencies to launder money, deal drugs, and commit other unlawful behavior. However, criminals have also been using digital currencies to ignore tax liabilities and evade responsibility. The Daily Beast article elaborated:\nThe document highlights how law enforcement isn’t only concerned with criminals accumulating bitcoin from selling drugs or hacking targets, but also those who use the currency to hide wealth or avoid paying taxes.\nReason for IRS Crackdown; Tracking Bitcoiners\nThe reason the IRS is cracking down on digital currencies appears to be because only 802 people declared bitcoin profits or losses in 2015. The Daily Beast article suggests that many people may have not expected the IRS to collect on digital currencies. Others may have just thought they could easily sidestep this alleged obligation.\nAs a result of this failure to pay taxes, the IRS consulted with Chainalysis.\nThey are now providing the IRS with tools to track bitcoin addresses through the blockchain and centralized exchanges. A Fortune article captured a screen shot of the letter:\nThe tool that Chainaylsis gave the IRS is called a refactor tool. It visualizes, tracks, and analysis transactions on the blockchain. Agencies from law enforcement, IRS, and banks will be able to use the tool , according to sources.\nTo date, records show the IRS has paid Chainaylsis $88,700 since 2015 for its services.\nTax Evaders and “Criminals” are Adapting; Coinbase Case Chainalysis\nEven though the IRS and companies such as Chainalysis are starting to hunt down blockchain users for evading taxes, enterprising individuals are adapting. They are now starting to use blockchains and cryptocurrencies that undermine current analytic techniques. For instance, the Wannacry hacker group supposedly moved their funds over into Monero to evade detection by law enforcement. Other crypto users may decide to use Zcash, which also employs more private and anonymous transaction measures.\nIn the past, the IRS has used multiple outlets to capture tax evaders using bitcoin. They have already tried to legally force Coinbase to hand over customer information. Currently, it looks like Coinbase may surrender customer data for those who exchanged over $20,000 worth of bitcoin on the platform. No telling what the court will rule in the end. News.Bitcoin.com covered the case in June:\nThe IRS will no longer target a wide-range of Coinbase users via its information request, which it filed on Coinbase back in March. Instead, the agency made concessions to seek account data of individuals who transacted — meaning they bought, sold, sent, or received — $20,000 worth of bitcoin in any transaction type.\nFull article at bitcoin.com\nPrepare for a full-out onslaught against the government’s newest enemy: crypto terrorists.\nThat means YOU, if you happen to own any Bitcoin.\nBecause as we highlighted in 2014, under new directives passed by the Obama Administration, concrete facts are not necessary for you to be put on any number of government watch lists :\nThe recently declassified Watchlisting Guidance rule book issued in 2013 and developed by members of 19 law enforcement agencies that include the FBI, NSA, CIA, and NSA, outlines the rules for placing individuals, including American citizens, on the various watch lists currently in use. As noted by The Intercept , the rules, much like America’s secretive anti-terrorism laws, are vague and often contradict each other.\nIt reveals a confounding and convoluted system filled with exceptions to its own rules, and it relies on the elastic concept of “reasonable suspicion” as a standard for determining whether someone is a possible threat.\nBecause the government tracks “suspected terrorists” as well as “known terrorists,” individuals can be watchlisted if they are suspected of being a suspected terrorist, or if they are suspected of associating with people who are suspected of terrorism activity.\n“Instead of a watchlist limited to actual, known terrorists, the government has built a vast system based on the unproven and flawed premise that it can predict if a person will commit a terrorist act in the future,” says Hina Shamsi, the head of the ACLU’s National Security Project. “On that dangerous theory, the government is secretly blacklisting people as suspected terrorists and giving them the impossible task of proving themselves innocent of a threat they haven’t carried out.”\nThe guidelines for who is or is not a terrorist are now so vague that any American could potentially be added to a list for something as menial as knowing someone who has committed an activity deemed to be of terrorist nature. And as has been highlighted previously, those activities could range from making a hand gesture that looks like a gun or manufacturing your own gold and silver coins .\nAnd now, of course, trading or owning Bitcoin.\nSource: http://silveristhenew.com/2017/08/25/is-bitcoin-really-anonymous-irs-moves-to-track-cryptocurrencies-with-new-chain-analysis-tools/",

      "text": "Computer science researchers at the University of California, Berkeley have developed new tools to identify sex trafficking rings, making them easier for law enforcement to target and prosecute. Those efforts have been stymied, according to the researchers’ report, by the vast quantity of ads for sex posted to websites like Backpage.com, only a portion of which may point to human trafficking or sex slavery. Screening thousands of new ads every day can also take a mental toll on human workers. The new technique, developed by a team including PhD candidate Rebecca S. Portnoff, combines two distinct approaches to solving that problem. First, the team created a machine-learning filter that finds stylistic similarities between ads for sex services posted to sites like Backpage.com. That makes it easier to distinguish between women voluntarily engaging in sex work, and those being forced into it by criminal organizations posting multiple ads. The second technique goes even deeper. Because Backpage is the most used portal for advertising sex services, credit card processors like Visa refused to service the site starting in 2015. That left Bitcoin as the preferred means of paying for ads. The Berkeley researchers took advantage of Bitcoin’s public blockchain — a record of all transactions — to identify payments for sex ads originating with the same Bitcoin user, again providing evidence of a larger organization and likelihood of trafficking. Those linkages could be used to subpoena further records from Bitcoin wallet services, or to expand on sting operations conducted using phone numbers or other contact information listed in the ads. Bitcoin was initially hailed as an anonymous way of paying for services, making it hugely popular among users of Darknet markets like Silk Road and, later, AlphaBay. But law enforcement and cybersecurity researchers have shown that it’s not hard to track and trace Bitcoin transactions, and even to connect them to real-world names. That has helped bring down dark markets, while also spurring the development of less traceable cryptocurrencies like Monero and Zcash. The Berkeley researchers said that, after encouraging tests, NGOs, companies, and law enforcement agencies are either already using, planning to use, or expressing strong interest in the new techniques.

      "text": "Why Monero? \nMonero is secure. \nMonero can't be hacked to steal your funds, due to the power of distributed consensus, which you can read about here. This means that you are responsible for your money, and don't have to trust any entity to keep it safe for you. \nMonero is private. \nThe power of the blockchain usually increases security at the cost of privacy, but with Monero's sophisticated privacy-centric technology, you get all of the security benefits of the blockchain without any of the privacy trade-offs. \nMonero is untraceable. \nBy taking advantage of ring signatures, Monero makes it ambiguous which funds have been spent, and thus extremely unlikely that a transaction could be linked to particular user. \nMonero is fungible. \nBecause of the on-by-default nature of the privacy technologies, Monero is fungible, meaning one Monero will always be equal to another. This means you won't have to worry about Monero blacklisted by exchanges or vendors. Rules Breaking the rules gets your post deleted and may result in a ban. Follow redditquette and the rules of reddit. Only Monero-related topics/links. Downvotes are for bad information or rudeness, not casual disagreement.

Shutterstock\nMonero prices hit an all-time high earlier today, pushing higher as the privacy-oriented digital currency continued to benefit from its recent listing on Korean exchange Bithumb.\nThe price of monero, which managed to generate widespread adoption on the dark web, reached $148.36 around 13:30 UTC, according to CoinMarketCap .\nMonero, which was trading for less than $40 at the start of August, has surged more than 250% so far this month and close to 1,000% year-to-date, additional CoinMarketCap figures show.\nThe privacy-oriented digital currency has experienced sharp gains this year as the broader cryptocurrency space draws substantial inflows. Investors have continued to pour funds into these digital assets, causing their total market value to repeatedly reach new highs, including a fresh record of more than $156 billion yesterday.\nDisclosure: I own some Bitcoin and Ether.",

      "text": "Monero prices hit an all-time high today, continuing to push higher after being listed on Korean exchange Bithumb. Shutterstock\nMonero prices hit an all-time high earlier today, pushing higher as the privacy-oriented digital currency continued to benefit from its recent listing on  Korean exchange Bithumb. \nThe price of monero, which managed to generate widespread adoption on the dark web, reached $148.36 around 13:30 UTC, according to CoinMarketCap .\nMonero, which was trading for less than $40 at the start of August, has surged more than 250% so far this month and close to 1,000% year-to-date, additional CoinMarketCap figures show.\n\nThe privacy-oriented digital currency has experienced sharp gains this year as the broader cryptocurrency space draws substantial inflows. Investors have continued to pour funds into these digital assets, causing their total market value to repeatedly reach new highs, including a fresh record of more than $156 billion yesterday.\n\nDisclosure: I own some Bitcoin and Ether.",
