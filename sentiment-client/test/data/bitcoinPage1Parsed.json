  "text": "Uncle Sam has Bitcoin traders on the radar these days, as the cryptocurrency passes $4,300 in late August trading.\nWith more assets pouring into digital currencies, the federal government, via the Internal Revenue Service , is looking to get its fair share from Bitcoin -- a cut that the IRS doesn't believe it's been getting until now.\nThat could change, and fast, as the IRS is using a software program that monitors Bitcoin-based digital addresses, in a campaign to identify potential tax evaders.\nUsing a customized software program from Chainalysis, a blockchain data analysis firm in New York City, the IRS expects to extract more intelligence -- and potentially more fraud -- from virtual currency movements through the blockchain and centralized currency exchanges. Chainalysis says it's able to track approximately 50% of all Bitcoin activity, and 4 million additional Bitcoin addresses, more than enough to get an accurate gauge on who's hiding cash from the IRS.\nAre you investing in cryptocurrency ?

Miner Bitcoins are taxed as business revenue when transferred to the miner.\"\nBut exchanges could and should report gains or losses on IRS Form 1099-B, just like stocks and bonds. \"This small change would assist taxpayers to comply with tax law they may be unintentional overlooking,\" Tarpey adds.\n\"Digital currency is growing rapidly and has many valid uses and avid supporters.

  "text": "10 Top Cryptocurrency Investors Share Their Favorite Long Term Picks 08/24/2017 09:20 am ET Updated 4 hours ago Licensed from Adobe Stock 730 \nThere’s a lot of focus right now on short-term speculation in the cryptocurrency space. But at some undefined future point, a reversal from speculation to value is going to happen. And when it does, you’ll want to be in the right positions. \nInvesting exclusively in tokens with real world value creation is the philosophy that my crypto hedge fund, General Crypto , is predicated on. Unless you’re a skilled day trader and don’t mind incredible stress levels, it’s wise to buy-and-hold coins with game-changing value rather than just jumping to and from the flavor of the week. \nAnalyzing the validity of that value isn’t easy. So I thought it would be interesting to hear what some very smart people who dedicate themselves full-time to crypto are betting on in the long-term. \nHere are each of their top three picks that they intend to hold (and not decrease position size) for at least the next two years, and why they believe in them so much. \nFood for thought: there is estimated to be around 100 crypto hedge funds currently spinning up in Q3 and Q4 2017. 100! Our fund was featured on Forbes as one of 15. This means a massive on-ramp of institutional capital — the likes of which crypto has never seen before — is about to be opened. And smart money is going to pick the smart cryptos. Here is what myself and nine others think they are going to back. Logan Kugler , Managing Partner at General Crypto \nI’ll start with my three favorite. \nRIPPLE ( XRP ) — Ripple is going after SWIFT, and their token XRP could entirely change the way we send money internationally. Why? Currently money takes days to move internationally, and the fees are enormous. There’s literally no way today to send money from one country to another same-day, other than by boarding a plane with a suitcase full of cash. XRP can transfer value (read: money) anywhere in the world in four seconds, at a cost of pennies . And unlike other coins, it doesn’t get bogged down when hit by huge volume. \nWhy am I bullish? The market size is as big as it gets (SWIFT moves $5 trillion USD per day ), the technology is already built (Ripple has been working on it since 2012), their team is world-class, and nearly 100 banking partnerships are already in place with pilots running or about to start. The CEO of SBI Holdings believes XRP will become the global standard in digital currencies. \nBitcoin maximalists like saying that XRP is not a true crypto because it’s not decentralized. The reality is Ripple is working towards making XRP even more decentralized than Bitcoin. It could take a while, but they’re already off to a good start . \nWhat some people miss about XRP is the timeline. Ripple stands to revolutionize the entire banking industry. That’s not going to happen overnight. It will have its rallies and its steep corrections, but I expect it to consistently go up. Don’t buy this one expecting big things to happen as fast as other coins. (And don’t get cold feet when it drops half.) The key difference is that XRP is predicated on an extremely strong use case, team, and technology. Be willing to buy now and hold this token for minimally the next five years and I think you’ll see an incredible return on investment. If you want a simple way to think about Ripple: XRP is going to let us move money across borders in the same way that we move information across them today. And that’s an astronomical upside. \nHere’s a long article I wrote about XRP if you’re interested in knowing more. \nPrice when this published: $0.266 \nFACTOM ( FCT ) — Factom offers the promise of immutable records. This could be huge for the (trillion-dollar) mortgage industry , banks and audit records, retail with huge databases like Target, studios with enormous catalogs of movies like Warner Bros., and governments for historical documents. Factom’s competitions are currently bounded by only proving the positive (e.g. “can we show X has existed in the chain?”), which would pertain to proof of existence, integrity, ownership, etc. — which is limited for the overall problem they are trying to solve. Factom can prove both the positive and the negative and see if a piece of information didn’t exist at a certain period in time, or whether it’s the latest version. Factom could change how major record keepers keep records and ensure eternal existence of all records. \nPrice when this published: $25.61 \nMONERO ( XMR ) — One of the original promises of Bitcoin was anonymity. It turns out it’s not quite as anonymous as a lot of people initially think. While who owns a particular wallet address is unknown, the transactions can be easily followed. So if your identity gets associated with a wallet address, some analysis can essentially turn your transactions into public bank statements. Enter anonymous coins (or “anon coins”), of which XMR is leading the field in privacy. It scrambles your address automatically each time, so you don’t have to worry about leaving a trail. I can see Monero XMR becoming very popular among those seeking anonymous transactions. What’s still up in the air is whether or not it can scale. Within hours of writing, XMR experienced a 50% price surge, which saw vastly extended transaction times. \nPrice when this published: $83.59 Spencer Bogart , Managing Director and Head of Research at Blockchain Capital \nBITCOIN ( BTC ) — Bitcoin has proven its ability to efficiently serve a few use cases that represent giant market opportunities. Amazon first proved it could efficiently sell things online and it focused on this ability before growing into other opportunities. I think the same will be true of Bitcoin. \nPrice when this published: $4,180 \nMONERO ( XMR ) — If I were forced to pick one thing that I was most concerned about for Bitcoin, it would be a lack of privacy. Each Bitcoin should be worth as much as any other Bitcoin, regardless of who owned it before you or what they did with it. For now, this isn’t a big problem. But Monero is a good hedge against this risk, since it’s more private than Bitcoin and therefore doesn’t have the same degree of fungibility risk. \nLITECOIN ( LTC ) — Silver to Bitcoin’s gold. The code is so similar to Bitcoin that Litecoin is able to leverage Bitcoin’s developer network and improvements. This is a big advantage over other coins that try to build a developer community from the ground up. If anything catastrophic happened to Bitcoin, a decent portion of the capital would likely flow to Litecoin. \nPrice when this published: $51.63 Rafe Furst , Chief Investment Officer at The Crypto Company \nDASH ( DASH ) — Bitcoin’s reign as the gateway cryptocurrency is coming to an end. The question is, what will replace it? Arguments can be made for Litecoin, Zcash, Ripple, or Monero. I like Dash because of its focus on consumer-friendliness and its flexible, decentralized governance protocol. For example, it took just 24 hours for the Dash community to approve a proposed blocksize increase back in 2016, while the Bitcoin community took three years to address its scalability problems, and the debate ended in a hard fork. \nPrice when this published: $296.56 \nETHEREUM ( ETH ) — While Ethereum won’t replace the function of Bitcoin, it will continue to play the important role it currently does as a smart-contract engine, and as a master blockchain to spawn new application tokens. \nPrice when this published: $324.99 \nSTEEM ( STEEM ) — Imagine if your social media posts could earn you money based on how popular they were. Imagine if you could get paid as tastemaker and curator of content published by others. Now what if the content creators kept 100% of the ownership rights to their content, and there were no advertisers or special interests getting between creators and fans? Steem is the first utility token that is truly being used for this function. Platforms like Reddit, Medium, and even Facebook should be nervous. \nPrice when this published: $1.25 Brad Mills , Fund Strategist at Alphabit \nBITCOIN ( BTC ) — I’ve been holding Bitcoin since 2011 when I started mining in my basement, and I will keep holding until it’s at least $100,000 per coin, which I expect in three to five years. Fundamentally strong, this is the original blockchain that is and was designed to be money. \nI get excited when I see Bitcoin becoming legal tender in countries like Japan, South Korea, and India. It's only a matter of time before a Bitcoin ETF is approved, and we see sovereign wealth and endowment funds allocating money into Bitcoin as a new asset class. \nMETAL ( MTL ) — Metal is one of Alphabit’s core positions that we will be holding long-term. Currently, it sits at only a $190 million market cap, which we think could grow to $1 billion or greater over the next year. Metal has the dual-use case of being not only a crypto-rewards token and peer-to-peer payments app like Venmo, but also an FDIC-insured fiat on-ramp bank in your pocket for the average person to make it easy to use cryptocurrency. For a competitor in market cap, I look at Dash which is currently at $2.3 billion, and also focusing on mass user adoption. \nPrice when this published: $8.78 \nWAVES ( WAVES ) — Waves is Russia's largest blockchain project. At it's core, it's a decentralized exchange and user-created token fundraising platform, forked from the NXT codebase. An ICO was held in 2016 that raised $16 million, which has grown to a market cap of over $300 million. \nThis month, a partnership was announced between Gazprombank and Waves. The partnership focuses on holding ICOs for Russian mining and metals companies, bringing a lot of legitimacy to the platform. \nPrice when this published: $4.64 CryptoYoda , well-respected cryptocurrency trader on Twitter \nLITECOIN ( LTC ) — It’s the second oldest and most trusted blockchain to date, and in addition to being about four times faster than Bitcoin, it has successfully managed to activate Segwit well before any blocksize debate, which to me is a sign of positive adaptability. For being a fork of Bitcoin with only minor differences in algorithm, trading at about 1.5% of Bitcoin's value is utterly insane, given it’s a more convenient payment coin. Bitcoin will primarily be a store-of-value, just as silver versus gold. \nETHEREUM CLASSIC ( ETC ) — The reason ETC’s price is so low compared to Ethereum (ETH) is the confusion about what happened during the hardfork a year ago. In July 2016, the community decided to hard fork the Ethereum blockchain in order to restore lost funds of DAO investors by rolling back the blockchain to a point in time before the hack. \nThere was huge resistance in the Ethereum community because of their devotion to the immutability of blockchains. Part of the community decided to violate that “law” to bail out those affected by the DAO hack, creating ETH. ETC is currently trading at 14.3% of ETH's value, which is a severe undervaluation in my eyes, given it's loyalty towards the core principle of cryptocurrency. \nPrice when this published: $15.51 \nZCASH ( ZEC ) — There are many undervalued coins offering anonymity to users, with Zcash and Monero being the most prominent. I think Zcash is positioned to be one of the biggest winners. It has huge interest, is elaborately designed, and has a high-security creation process and very limited supply. Its lack of recent price advancement indicates to me that traders are accumulating it. \nPrice when this published: $231.04 Romano , well-respected cryptocurrency trader on Twitter; also the lead developer of Viacoin (VIA) \nSTRATIS ( STRAT ) — Stratis makes blockchain easy for enterprise. They offer simple and affordable end-to-end solutions for development, testing and deployment of native C# blockchain applications. Ever see an article that talks about a bank starting to use blockchain technology? They don't use the Bitcoin blockchain, but a private chain like Stratis. Stratis makes it easier than ever before for organizations to deploy private blockchains. They’re in talks with many huge companies like Microsoft, Jaguar, Reuters, Cashaa, AIA Group, RBC Capital Markets, Deutsche Bank, etc. \nPrice when this published: $6.09 \nDECRED ( DCR ) — Decred will soon get the Lightening Network. Which means you can send small transactions for almost no fee, instantly. The Lightening Network is a big thing which many underestimate. Notable about Decred is that they’ve learned and implemented a lot from the success of Dash. But whereas Dash has a lot of outside funding (and is accountable to investors), Decred is self-funded via block subsidy (accountable only to its users) and they are entirely transparent about the allocations. Decred has decentralized voting, Charlie Lee (Litecoin’s lead developer) on their team, and their code looks clean and is beautifully written. \nPrice when this published: $29.97 \nZCOIN ( XZC ) — While a lot of other anonymous coins bill themselves as completely anonymous, they are not, as this video explains . This is also a great article explaining why most anon coins aren’t actually completely anonymous. Only ZCoin is completely anonymous and I think at some point the market will recognize that and it will be in the same league market cap wise as Monero. Right now, ZCoin looks very undervalued to me as their market cap is only $26 million (compared to Monero’s $1.2 billion). Also worth noting: Roger Ver has said good things about ZCoin (and I don't like Roger Ver at all, but he has very deep pockets). \nPrice when this published: $9.55 CryptoVisionary , founder of the Phoenix Trading Group \nRIPPLE ( XRP ) — Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), the technology that powers Ripple and its associated coin XRP, allows anyone anywhere in the world to transact money in the same way as sending data (at fractions of the cost). For markets such as international remittance, this means monumental change is underway. ($500 billion is transacted yearly in the remittance sector.) Many of the largest banks in the world (more than 100) have plans to leverage DLT and Ripple to cut costs for their payment servicing. In fact, even the Federal Reserve and the Central Bank of England are testing out Ripple for real-time payment capabilities. \nAUGUR ( REP ) — Businesses around the world pay a high premium for actionable intelligence for their own internal and strategic needs. With Augur, anyone in the world can obtain information on the probability of a future event. Think of it as the Google search for future events, peering into the future using a fascinating principle known as wisdom of the crowd. Such a technology could drastically impact many industries, including trillion-dollar or larger industries like gambling and sports betting. \nPrice when this published: $22.59 \nQTUM ( QTUM ) — Think of Qtum like an Ethereum for China, except that it's a Proof of Stake coin. It’s a more environmentally friendly way to secure the network, with a drastic reduction in the consumption of electricity compared to Proof of Work systems like Bitcoin. Like Ethereum, Qtum will host a number of applications developed by independent third parties, has an all-star cast in terms of advisors (one of their co-founders was recently cited in Forbes China’s “30 Under 30” list.) \nPrice when this published: $13.49 notsofast , well-respected cryptocurrency trader on Twitter \nBLOCKNET ( BLOCK ) — Of all projects competing to release a decentralized, native cryptocurrency exchange, Blocknet's technology is far and away the strongest, easiest to implement, and closest to market. \nBlocknet removes the third-party risk in sending your coins to trade on an exchange. You can collateralize 5,000 blocknet in a service node, run any wallets you want on the same machine as that node, and earn BLOCK in trade fees whenever someone trades a currency your node supports. The blocknet protocol will fundamentally advance the use of blockchains the way IE or Netscape standardized and unlocked the World Wide Web. \nPrice when this published: $14.12 \nUBIQ ( UBQ ) — The DAO philosophical failure and Ethereum network split opened the door to competitors on smart contract blockchains. Ubiq is the strongest: immutable unlike ETH, and with a brand focus away from experimentation and toward corporate professionalism. Once the Ethereum ICO craze breaks and that platform loses trust, Ubiq's secure network and failure-free track record will present it as a viable smart contract competitor. \nPrice when this published: $1.55 \nPARKBYTE ( PKB ) (Soon to be ParkChain; PKC) — Parkbyte is my appcoin bet. It's a simple premise to disrupt a ubiquitous and unsexy industry with better tracking, standardized UX, and lower costs and efficiency throughout. Via industry experience, the developers acutely understands exactly what needs to be pitched to whom in order to disrupt existing pay-to-park systems with a blockchain implementation. \nPrice when this published: $0.278 Squeeze , well-respected cryptocurrency trader on Twitter \nCIVIC ( CVC ) — Civic is a secure identity platform that uses the Civic tokens for identification purposes. Vinny Lingham is the CEO of Civic and he's one of the \"Sharks\" on Shark Tank South Africa. Civic has both the concept and the team. With Vinny's connections and influence, many sites have already integrated Civic. For this type of identity verification, user adoption is very important. Without adoption, there's no use case. \nPrice when this published: $0.546 \nTEZOS (TEZ) — By far, the biggest ICO funding, with $230 million. It has huge names backing it like billionaire Tim Draper. Their algorithm runs on a delegated proof of stake system. It is also capable of anonymous transactions which utilizes the Zcash's proof circuit on a side token. They have plans to replace this process with a better option in the future. It is also possible to create applications on Tezos similar to Ethereum. I have no doubt that it will hit a multibillion market cap in a year. \nPrice when this published: (not publicly traded yet) \nLISK ( LSK ) — This is one of the underdogs that a lot of people missed. It's currently at $233 million market cap. Lisk (similar to Tezos) is utilizing the Delegated Proof of Stake system, where \"delegates\" verify the transactions and have voting capabilities that steer the direction of Lisk. \nThe main development plan this year is to create an SDK for developing and deploying blockchain applications (smart contracts). They have a strong development team and they have sufficient funds ($62 million) to keep it going for tens of years. \nPrice when this published: $3.42 sicarious , well-respected cryptocurrency trader on Twitter \nDECRED ( DCR ) — Decred is perhaps the most innovative Proof of Stake coin on the market today, and boasts an impressive (and production ready) decentralized governance system. In addition to governance solutions, Decred is preparing to throw their hat into the ring of anonymous transactions later this year.

  "title": "AI uses bitcoin trail to find and help sex-trafficking victims",
  "text": "AI uses bitcoin trail to find and help sex-trafficking victims Follow the money APA-PictureDesk GmbH/REX/Shutterstock By Timothy Revell \nAfter Kubiiki Pride’s 13-year-old daughter disappeared , it took 270 days for her mother to find her. When she did, it was as an escort available to be rented out on an online classified web site. Her daughter had been drugged and beaten into compliance by a sex trafficker. \nTo find her, Pride had to trawl through hundreds of advertisements on Backpage.com, a site that in 2012, the last date for which stats are available, was hosting more than 70 per cent of the US market for online sex ads. When it comes to identifying signs of human trafficking in online sex adverts, the task for police is often no easier. Thousands of sex-related classifieds are posted every week. Some are legal posts. Other people, like Pride’s daughter, are forced to do it. Working out which ads involve foul play is a laborious task. \nHowever, the task is being automated using a strange alliance of artificial intelligence and bitcoin . Advertisement Learn about the future of AI: Join DeepMind founder Demis Hassabis at New Scientist Live \n“The internet has facilitated a lot of methods that traffickers can take advantage of. They can easily reach big audiences and generate a lot of content without having to reveal themselves,” says Rebecca Portnoff at the University of California, Berkeley. \nBut a new tool developed by Portnoff and her colleagues can ferret traffickers out. It uses machine learning to spot common patterns in suspicious ads , and then uses publicly available information from the payment method used to pay for them – bitcoin – to help identify who placed them. The digital trail \nThe tool will help not only the investigation and intervention of potential traffickers, “but also to support prosecution efforts in an arena where money moves with rapidity across financial instruments and disappears from the evidence trail”, says Carrie Pemberton Ford at the Cambridge Centre for Applied Research in Human Trafficking . \nThere are about 4.5 million people who have been forced into sexual exploitation . In the US, many of them end up advertised on Backpage, the second biggest classified ad listing site. People list everything from events to furniture there, but it has also become associated with sex ads and sex trafficking – so much so that the US National Center for Missing and Exploited Children has said that the majority of child sex trafficking cases referred to them involve ads on Backpage. \nNormally, the tell-tale sign that an advert involves trafficking is that the person behind it is responsible for many other adverts across the site. However, this is difficult to spot, as adverts mention the people being trafficked, not the traffickers. \nTo identify the authors of online sex ads, Portnoff’s tool looks at the style in which ads are written. Artificial intelligence trained on thousands of different adverts highlights when similar styles have been used, and clusters together likely candidates for further investigation. \nThe second step comes via the payment method. Credit card companies stopped the use of their services on Backpage in 2015, leaving bitcoin as the only way to paying for adverts. \nEvery transaction made using bitcoin is logged on a publicly available ledger called the blockchain . It doesn’t store identities, but every user has an associated wallet that is recorded alongside the transaction. The AI tool searches the blockchain to identify the wallet that corresponds to each advert. Evidence for the prosecution \nIt is also easy to see when each ad was posted. “We look at cost of the ad and the timestamp, then connect the ad to a specific person or group. This means the police then have a pretty good candidate for further investigation,” says Portnoff. \nOnce the police know which ads are of dubious origin, they can call the numbers on them in the knowledge that they might well be linked to crime. “Narrowing down from the hundreds of thousands of ads online will be very useful for law enforcement officers who have to read through so many ads during an investigation,” says Portnoff. \nDuring a four-week period, the research team tried out their tool on 10,000 adverts. It correctly identified about 90 per cent of adverts that had the same author, with a false positive rate of only 1 per cent. One of the bitcoin wallets they tracked down was responsible for $150,000 worth of sex adverts, possible evidence of an exploitation ring. \nBackpage has not yet responded to New Scientist ’s requests for comment. \nThe team is working with a number of different police forces and NGOs with the hope of using the tool in real investigations soon. The work was presented at the Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining in Canada this month. \nThe trafficker who kidnapped Kubiiki Pride’s daughter was eventually caught and sentenced to five years in prison. Successfully prosecutions like that are rare, but with Portnoff’s new tool that could soon change. \nMore on these topics:",

  "text": "HBO’s Twitter, Facebook accounts hacked \nJust a day before the last episode of “Game of Thrones” Season 7 set to hit the screens, the HBO hackers calling themselves as “Mr Smith” have leaked the climax of the ongoing season, thus ending the suspense that kept the millions of fans on toes. \nAccording to Mashable on Friday, the hacking group which stole approximately 1.5 terabytes of data from HBO have released, what they call, a sixth wave of leaks that contain confidential plot summaries and details of how the season will end. “Mashable has read the confidential summary but has chosen not to publish the explicit details,” the report said. \nIn response, HBO has said the hackers may continue to drop bits and pieces of stolen information in an attempt to generate media attention. “That’s a game we’re not going to participate in,” HBO was quoted as saying. \nThe hacking group demanded approximately $6.5 million worth of Bitcoin from HBO but that demand has not been met so far. However, the hacking group claimed to have sold the stolen data to three customers in deep web who paid them half of the amount they had requested in ransom from HBO. \n“By the way, we officially inform you and other hundreds of reporters whom we are emailing that we sold ‘HBO IS FALLING’ entire collection (5 TB) to three customers in deep web and we earned half of the requested ransom,” the hackers said. “We put a condition for our respected customers and they approved. We will leak many many waves of HBO’s internal stuff to punish them for playing us and set an example of greedy corporation.” For all the latest Technology News , download Indian Express App More Related News ",

  "title": "The Bitcoin Sovereign Wealth Fund - Bloomberg Gadfly",
  "text": "Share Aug 25, 2017 2:00 AM EDT \nThe crypto-currency boom is in full swing. The explosion in price and quantity of new digital tokens is so bonkers even its evangelists are calling the market a ticking time-bomb . \nBitcoin's gain 1,323% \nIt's also tempting the establishment to get in on the act. For the Republic of Estonia, it's being touted as a way to raise a sovereign wealth fund -- an imaginative leap for a country with a population one-sixth the size of New York City's and one of the highest levels of mobile broadband penetration in the world. A Bitcoin-Ready Nation? Wireless mobile broadband subscriptions per 100 inhabitants, Q2 2016 Source: OECD \nA proposal by Estonia's agency in charge of \"e-residency\" applications (more on this later) has suggested raising money by selling \"estcoins\" to the public. \nThe wealth could then be managed via a public-private partnership; a chunk might be poured into venture capital to support domestic start-ups. Holders of estcoins would have a stake in the fund and a say in how it is run. The tokens might then become a viable currency, so the thinking goes, paying for goods and services in a euro-zone country. \nThis seems like a bid to add financial firepower to a tiny economy whose capital markets are under-developed and eclipsed by loans from foreign banks. More than 90% of the Estonian market is controlled by foreign firms like Swedbank, SEB and Nordea, according to investment bank Redgate Capital. A Gap To Fill Estonia's banking market is highly concentrated and dwarfs under-developed capital markets Source: Redgate Capital \nEstonia lacks the natural resources of Norway or Qatar, but has reinvented itself as digitally savvy economy that's open for business: corporate and income tax rates are less than the OECD average, it ranks twelfth globally in terms of ease of doing business and allows anyone in the world to become an \"e-resident\" and start a company. With Estonia's e-population apparently growing faster than the domestic birth rate, tapping this group for funds must be a temptation. Hot Market, Burnt Fingers Bitcoin trackers reflect the crypto-currency boom, where daily price swings can be huge Source: Bloomberg \nBut there are huge risks here. The price of crypto-currencies is incredibly volatile: Bitcoin has jumped 340 percent year-to-date, and in 2013 it once fell 50 percent overnight . \nIn theory, an estcoin would be backed by hard assets like infrastructure projects or cash flows from investments, so might be easier to value. \nIn practice, there's no telling how these coins would trade and how they might destabilize Estonia's economy and politics. Would this new coin create two classes of citizens, depending on whether their savings were in euros or estcoins? Would Estonia repay debts in either currency, or both? Any outsized influence of foreigners who are also e-residents might lead to extra friction -- imagine a deep-pocketed overseas investor owning more than half of the republic's flag-waving token. \nA sovereign crypto-currency backed by people whose personal details are stored online would also surely be a juicy magnet for hackers and criminals. \nThe estcoin proposal seems to be leaning towards Ethereum as technology of choice and has received feedback from its founder, Vitalik Buterin -- who has also been in contact with Vladimir Putin about Russia's own crypto ambitions . \nEthereum has a choppy history of community-managed investment funds: One such experiment, the DAO, was hacked in a $55 million digital heist . Estonia also has a history of being targeted by cyber-attacks. In 2007 , banks, media outlets and government bodies were forced offline. Estonia blamed Russia , which denied involvement. People might also target estcoins to bypass the regulated banking system. A $120 Billion Market Market capitalization of the top five crypto-currencies Source: Coincap \nThis is a proposal that's still at the conceptual stage, and the agency involved acknowledges there are risks that need to be addressed before taking any step forward. There's little doubt that in the current mood of crypto-enthusiasm, where millions are being thrown at dubious business propositions, an estcoin would succeed in raising money. The long-term cost could well be volatility, insecurity and poverty. \nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.

  "text": "Cryptocurrencies: Another digital gold rush? We examine the rise of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and its implications for the global monetary system. 26 Aug 2017 12:53 GMT Business & Economy , Bitcoin Story highlights Cryptocurrencies are a form of digital money designed to be secure and they don't need banks to issue them. Bitcoin was the first such decentralised currency. More and more businesses, large and small, accept bitcoin payments every day. Over 900 newer coins like ethereum, Zcash, litecoin and Ripple have sprung up. \nThe world's top central bankers have been gathering in Wyoming, US, last week for their annual Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium to discuss important global economic challenges. \nAs the world slowly moves away from the loose monetary policy that was put in place in the aftermath of the financial crisis, there's a sense that the economy is entering a new, digital phase. So the next generation of central bankers might have to deal with issues such as the regulation of cryptocurrencies, which are rapidly gaining popularity. \nThis month, bitcoin , hit an all-time high. The price of the world's most well-known cryptocurrency has soared from less than $20 in 2012 to around $4,000 currently. \nCryptocurrencies, unlike loose currency, are created using digital technology called blockchain, a borderless, anonymous way of using and creating online money. But most importantly, it's completely decentralised. No one person has total control, so no banks. It's value comes from the network of people using it. \nSo is the world headed towards a cashless economy? And is the world ready for a cryptocurrency monetary system? \nI don't think [digital currencies] will ever replace the system, but I do think it will give us the option of holding our monetary authorities to a higher standard than just being able to do what they want with our money. Llew Claasen, executive director, Bitcoin Foundation \n\"Everyone's a little bit nervous about a technology which ultimately has the potential to make dramatic changes to the financial system, in particular, its potential use for tax evasion and money-laundering,\" explains Llew Claasen of South Africa-based Newtown Partners. \nHowever, a recently published report by the European Commission suggests that \"in reality, there's not much illegal activity happening using these kinds of technologies. They're transformative and more about financial inclusion than they're about creating harm,\" says Claasen, who's also the executive director of the Washington-based Bitcoin Foundation, a nonprofit corporation that wants to promote the use of bitcoin money for users around the world. \nAsked about bitcoin's soaring prices, Claasen says that \"while there's certainly enough evidence to suggest that bitcoin is worth $4,000 ... it's still a high-risk asset to have ... By the end of the year, we're expecting bitcoin to go up to about $5,000 and high volatility to continue. So, if you're going to buy, I would suggest that you buy small amounts of bitcoin using money that you're quite happy to lose and to hold on to those bitcoins for as long as possible and not engage in short-term trading, which will be very high-risk.\" \nAccording to Claasen, it is unlikely for paper currency to be completely replaced by digital coins, but \"it gives us a choice. Right now, we have no control over what central banks do with money supply ... so it gives us another option - aside from gold - that we can easily move.\" \n\"So, I don't think it'll ever replace the system, but I do think it will give us the option of holding our monetary authorities to a higher standard than just being able to do what they want with our money.\" \nAlso on this episode of Counting the Cost : \nArtificial intelligence : Staying in the digital economy, some experts believe artificial intelligence (AI) is developing at such a pace it's leaving government regulators behind. This week, a group of AI founders called for a ban on the technology's use to design weapons. That call is to prevent the sort of nightmare scenarios previously confined to science fiction, as Yaara Bou Melhem reports from Melbourne. \nSamsung troubles : The heir of the world's biggest smartphone maker and one of the most profitable chip makers has been found guilty of corruption .

The US' longest war has dragged on for nearly 16 years and has claimed more than 100,000 lives, cost the US more than $700bn, and left the Afghan economy in tatters.

  "text": "By Jason Murdock On 8/24/17 at 3:59 PM John McAfee, founder of the eponymous anti-virus company, speaks during the China Internet Security Conference in Beijing on August 16, 2016 FRED DUFOUR/AFP/Getty Images \nMGT Capital Investments Inc., where US anti-virus pioneer John McAfee currently works as 'chief cybersecurity visionary', this week (Wednesday 23 August) announced the completion of a hefty investment deal worth $2.4m to help bolster its bitcoin mining operation. \nThe fresh financing for MGT came as a result of a 10% convertible note issued to UAHC Ventures LLC - a subsidiary of a publicly traded entity called United American Healthcare Corp. MGT has now issued UAHC with a warrant to purchase shares of MGT's common stock. \n\"The note is self-amortising with a maximum repayment of $160,000 (£124,880) per month,\" MGT Capital Investments said in a release to shareholders . Advertisement \nStephen Schaeffer, president of MGT's cryptocurrency division, commented on the deal, claiming it was \"further evidence of our commitment to being the leading miner in the North America. \n\"We are currently constructing our third location in Washington State, and plan to deploy new mining rigs in this facility in early October 2017,\" he added. \nJohn Fife, the chief executive officer (CEO) of UAHC Ventures, said : \"We've identified MGT Capital Investments as a leader in bitcoin mining. \n\"Today we see bitcoin and related-mining activities as a promising and fast-growing segment of the digital currency sector. We will further explore potential value-adding opportunities in the digital currency space, as they present themselves\". \nOn 17 August, MGT revealed that it had recently \"passed a milestone\" of having mined 1,000 bitcoins since it began operations in September 2016. \nThe company continues to push both its enterprise network-monitoring system \"Sentinel\" and a so-called Privacy Phone – which now has a tentative release window of February 2018. \nIt recently emerged that McAfee was changing job titles within the company, going from leading the entire business as CEO to instead have a greater focus on product design. Advertisement \nIn an interview with I BTimes UK last year, he said that cryptocurrency will be the future of finance. \n\"I don't know if it will be bitcoin or multiples [of different currencies] but there will be a cryptocurrency standard for the world whether governments like it or not,\" he stated. \n\"There will have to be some other mode of collecting taxes, whether it's a tariff on the use of national parks or the use of the roads – I don't have a clue – that's the government's problem and not mine. But it's coming and it will change the culture of this world.\" \nIn a recent column for IBTimes UK, he wrote about why the word 'bubble' cannot be applied to bitcoin, which remains one of most popular forms of digital currencies today.

  "title": "Plug The Security Holes In Your Two-Factor Authentication | Lifehacker UK",
  "text": "By Staff on at \nOn Tuesday, Techcrunch writer John Biggs had his phone number stolen by a hacker who gained control of Biggs’ T-Mobile SIM card, granting him access to Biggs’ phone number used to verify his identity. Biggs correctly employed SMS-based two-factor authentication on his accounts, but forgot to add extra security layers to his wireless carrier account. His attacker proceeded to lock him out of his accounts and attempt to demand ransom in bitcoin. \nBiggs was eventually able to recover his accounts and regain control over his phone number, but you can turn his evening of headaches and password resetting into a teachable moment for yourself, and learn how to stop a similar incident from happening to you. Put a PIN in Your Phone Account \nThe easiest way to make sure no one can seize control of your phone’s wireless account is by adding a security PIN or passcode. It’s as simple as calling your phone network and asking to enable PIN protection (it’s free), or logging into your online account and visiting your security settings. \nThis isn’t the same PIN you might use to unlock your smartphone, but a number or passcode you’ll need to enter or say whenever you’re dealing with your carrier or network. If you’re on the line with a customer support representative, you won’t be able to make any changes to your account without providing a PIN or passcode. You can set up your PIN by calling your carrier or visiting a shop with valid identification. Use Better Two-Factor Authentication Services \nSMS-based authentication, used to verify your identity by texting you a random passcode needed to access your account, is a good start to a more secure digital life, but you’ll have to step it up a notch if you want to make sure there are no security holes. As a rule, it should only be used when no other two-factor authentication process is available. \nKeep in mind your phone may not be the only device receiving that authentication message, especially if your messages are synced between multiple devices, like your tablet or computer. They could be sent to other online messaging services like Google Voice or Skype, services that can be accessed from places besides your smartphone. It’s also susceptible, as Briggs discovered, to carrier-based SIM card transfers if the proper security protocols aren’t in place. \nTwo-factor authentication apps like Authy or Google Authenticator are much more secure, and don’t involve email addresses or text messages, granting attackers fewer entry points. Setup is a bit more involved than entering a number sent to your phone, and requires you to have your authentication device, whether it’s a smartphone or tablet, in hand while you enter the periodically randomised string of numbers. Employ a Password Manager \nDon’t think that adding more layers of security means you’ll have to remember every new PIN, password, or other secret code. While you’re setting up additional security checkpoints, enter the information in the password manager of your choice . You can use it to store backup codes, customer support numbers, or a carrier-exclusive email address, ensuring it both stays far from snooping hackers and accessible only to you. Keep Your One-Time Codes Handy \nSetting up two-factor authentication apps like Google Authenticator usually involves saving a backup passcode in the event your phone is missing or stolen. Google suggests you print them out and store them in a secure location. You can keep them in a folder tucked away in your home somewhere, or inside your password manager for easy access. No matter what, having a backup plan in case your original backup plan goes down is a great method of keeping yourself secure and your identity safe from malicious individuals. \nImage credit: MIKI Yoshihito/ Flickr Tags: ",

  "title": "A sketchy Satoshi has popped up to promote his new blockchain",
  "text": "Last night, The Verge and at least three other outlets received an email from someone claiming to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious inventor of bitcoin. The email we received was brief and to the point: “I met with the SEC yesterday. I am ready to talk.”\nThe individual declined to give his legal name, but said recent leaks had forced him to speak to the press, even as he intended to remain anonymous. At the same time, he claimed that various agencies in the government, including the SEC, IRS, and FBI were aware of his true identity. “The government knows who I am, and that’s the way it should be,” he said in a call with The Verge . “The public doesn’t know, and I’m going to have it remain that way.”\nBut in the emails and conversations that followed, it became clear that the would-be Satoshi’s primary purpose was to promote a new blockchain detailed at CoinProject.org — and significant doubts emerged about whether he was in fact Bitcoin’s mysterious creator, or simply a scammer hoping to draw attention to a speculative cryptocurrency.\n“The public doesn’t know, and I’m going to have it remain that way.” While the man offered significant detail on Coin, he was unable to provide the kind of evidence that would be necessary to definitively prove his identity as Satoshi. He declined to sign a message with a PGP key that is linked to Satoshi’s online persona, did not demonstrate access to old email addresses (which, to be fair, have largely been compromised ), and most importantly, would not move bitcoins that are known to belong to the real Satoshi. He claimed that, on leaving the project in 2010, he had deleted all the private keys linked to Satoshi, hoping to destroy any evidence of his role in Bitcoin’s origin. As a result, it was impossible to present any cryptographic proof of his identity.\nThe evidence he did present was extensive, but every piece of it was already available from previous sources. In one email, he sent a copy of the two earliest known instances of the bitcoin protocol, alpha versions 0.1.0 and 0.1.3, both of which are believed to have been coded and compiled by Satoshi himself. But those versions were shared widely by Nakamoto at the time of release, and are already freely available from the Satoshi Nakamoto Institute .\n“He is a fake.” This ostensible Satoshi also presented screenshots of emails between him and cryptographer Wei Dai, who is often named as the creator of a precursor to modern cryptocurrency . The emails were dated to August 2008, showing Satoshi writing from his anonymousspeech.com account to talk cryptocurrency protocols with Dai during a time when the Bitcoin protocol was still in active development. But like the alpha versions, those emails are already publicly available. They were published in a blog post in 2014 , as part of a larger argument about whether cryptographer Nick Szabo was the true Satoshi.\nThe man said he would reveal further proof of his identity today, along with further details on the new blockchain project. However, he abruptly cut off communication, and did not respond to further emails or calls.\nOther claims made by this “Satoshi” have also proven hard to pin down. In one email, he claimed prominent Bitcoin investor Tim Draper had met with the SEC as part of the process. Reached by The Verge , Draper said simply, “he is a fake.” In a later tweet , Draper acknowledged he had been contacted by “a Satoshi fake.”\n“He was very convincing and wasted a lot of my time,” Draper wrote. “Could have been much worse.”\nIt would not be the first time a Satoshi claim has fallen through. In 2014, Newsweek identified model-train enthusiast Dorian Nakamoto as the Bitcoin creator in a widely disputed article that spurred a lawsuit from Dorian himself. In 2015, Craig Wright also made a contested claim to have invented Bitcoin. It later became clear that he had made a multi-million dollar deal with a Canadian peer-to-peer payment startup premised on his ability to prove that he was the inventor of Bitcoin.\nThis latest iteration of Satoshi-spotting comes at a time when ICO madness has reached a fever pitch. In 2014, it was undesirable, even perceived as potentially dangerous , to be identified as Bitcoin’s creator. Since late 2015, it has been seen as potentially quite lucrative. With no end in sight for the cryptocurrency hype, there’s a good chance we’ll continue to see more Satoshis emerge.\nCorrection: An earlier version of this article stated that Tim Draper denied ever meeting the founder of CoinProject.org. In fact, Draper simply wrote, “he is a fake.” We have updated with a further statement from Draper. The Verge regrets the error.",

Bernanke, who has criticized cryptocurrencies in the past, will be interviewed by Gene Sperling, the former national economic adviser under Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. \nBernanke wrote that virtual currencies could have “long-term promise” in a 2013 letter to Congress. However, in a 2015 interview with Quartz, he said bitcoin has “some serious problems,” including its anonymity and lack of stability. Bernanke was not immediately available to comment. \nSince the former Fed chairman’s remarks, the largest cryptocurrency has skyrocketed in value, fueling excitement among enthusiasts but skepticism among critics worried that the digital coin is in a bubble. \nRelated: ",

  "title": "The geopolitical prowess of science and technology",
  "text": "India needs to build the infrastructure which can generate new technologies. Photo: Mint In a recent article in the Financial Times , US secretary of commerce Wilbur Ross accused China of stealing the “American genius”. Ross underscores two themes—one that China and the US are bound for a long tussle and, two, that science and technology (S&T) is part of geopolitics. China aspires to be a technology leader but the US stands in its way. China will go to any length to win—from mandatory technology transfers to strategic investments in disruptive American ventures. \nS&T has long been regarded as important for economic growth—in fact, Edwin Mansfield and Joseph Alois Schumpeter considered technological change as one of the most important factors, if not the factor. And as we see from the jockeying between the US and China, S&T is also a crucial tool to pursue a geopolitical agenda and build strategic leverage in international affairs. \nIndeed, S&T is critical for ensuring national security and opening new market opportunities. Moreover, economic competitiveness has become a proxy for military influence. Ownership of superior technology brings greater power and control. To build capacity, nations rely on several policy levers—patent laws, tax incentives, and grants to labs—to spur the public sector, private enterprise and academia. \nTake the example of middle powers such as Canada and Switzerland. It is their S&T capabilities that help them stay relevant in the international arena. Estonia is another remarkable example of how a country can leverage its digital ecosystem to boost its position in the international arena. \nSimilarly, Israel—a small country with a complicated past in an unforgiving neighbourhood—has been able to consistently punch above its weight because of its technological prowess. In fact, one of the reasons for India’s recent tilt towards Israel is the latter’s strength in S&T, especially in agriculture. In other words, Israel’s thriving high-tech ecosystem serves the triple purpose of boosting economic growth, ensuring national security, and offering international leverage. \nFor the past 50 years, the US has been the world’s superpower. It is no coincidence that the period correlates with America’s leadership in S&T. The increased pace of scientific development came at the beginning of World War I with the establishment of the Council of National Defence and the National Research Council. World War II also had a dramatic impact—leading to the development of the atomic weapon and the radar. Foundations of Silicon Valley were laid during and because of the war. The Cold War gave a big push to the US space programme. \nAmerican’s Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency is a national treasure—it gave birth to the internet and the global positioning system (GPS), and ushered in an unparalleled era of US hegemony. The military and the Central Intelligence Agency maintain separate arms investing in the world’s leading technologies. \nAlphabet and Palantir are private businesses but can act as proxies for their state—and they do play a geopolitical role. Google’s origins can be traced to a grant from the National Science Foundation.\nFacebook has some data centres offshore but it is a distinctly American corporation which controls large amounts of data generated around the world. This is power in today’s age. The US continues in its leadership position because of its enviable university system and islands of excellence such as Boston and Seattle.\nAccording to Sophie Roborgh at the Hague Centre for Strategic Studies, Chinese innovation policy is a “geopolitical instrument to gain economic... And military supremacy”. China aspires for global domination and it is playing the long game. Innovation takes centre stage and it is seen through geopolitical glasses. China has identified 10 technology areas as part of its New Industry Policy 2025 and aims to become an “innovative country”. Some have begun to call this the Beijing Consensus. \nChina’s investments in clean energy and space have made technology an “important pawn in the power play between the West and China”, argues Roborgh. China is challenging America’s dominance of the knowledge economy. Former US energy secretary Steven Chu considers this to be a “Sputnik moment”, drawing analogies to the Cold War space race between the US and the Soviet Union. Today, China aims to become a superpower in Artificial Intelligence, leading to a technology race with the US. In biotechnology, there is already a US-China dispute over genetic data. China controls 70% of all the mining capacity of bitcoins and it is giving researchers significant financial incentives to publish in reputed journals. The Chinese government also invests strategically in the US, particularly in Silicon Valley. \nAt home, as India rediscovers its foreign policy mojo, it must act on similar lines. India’s recent efforts to shore up its domestic defence manufacturing industry, develop a regional satellite for South Asia and a home-grown GPS, as well as establish 20 world-class universities, are all steps in the right direction. \nBut a quick look at the numbers shows how much still needs to be done. As per the 2015 report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, the US spent $433 billion—that’s 2.7% of its GDP—on research and development (R&D) in 2013. South Korea and Israel each spent 4% of their GDP while China is targeting 2.5% by 2020. India currently spends only 0.9% of GDP on R&D. \nTo move forward, India needs to recognize the geopolitical reality of S&T. It needs to identify focus areas, analyse what kind of role it can play and where the state can make tactical investments overseas. More specifically, India needs to build the infrastructure which can generate new technologies. It needs to invest in human capital, maintain a cadre of top scientists and professionals, and develop industry-lab links.\nVinayak Dalmia is an entrepreneur. \nComments are welcome at theirview@livemint.com \nFirst Published: Thu, Aug 24 2017. 11 31 PM IST",

  "title": "The future of Venture Capital & ICOs – UTRUST – Medium",
  "text": "Aug 23 The future of Venture Capital & ICOs If you want to understand why cryptos are getting the spotlight, you have to understand the ‘behind-the-scenes catalyst’ which is driving the market. It is called Token sale or Initial Coin Offering (ICO). Money raised by start-ups via so-called ICOs has surpassed early stage Venture Capital funding for technology companies in 2017. Today, ICOs are the way for start-ups to raise money by selling tokens to backers sort of as an equity and similar to an Initial Public Offering (IPO). ICOs present both benefits and disadvantages, as well as threats and opportunities, to the traditional venture capital business model. An ICO typically starts with the creation of a new crypto-token on a protocol such as Ethereum, Counterparty, Neo, Ubiq or Openledger etc. and a value is arbitrarily determined by the start-up team behind the ICO. Then the price dynamics determined by market supply and demand and the value is settled on by the network of participants, rather than by a central authority. Venture Capitalists who are generally still cautious regarding the ICO business model are now becoming more interested in it for a number of reasons. “ICO as a new business model leveraging blockchain technology will sustain as the digital way, combining crowdfunding and (a) new hybrid asset class of equity ownership and currency,” Oliver Bussmann, Bussmann Advisory, Crypto Valley Association, Innovate Finance The first reason is because of profits .VCs are hungry for massive returns for their investors and 2016 & 2017 brought huge profits from blockchain start-ups, for example Stratis made an ROI since ICO(20.06.2016) +90,976% while Metal ROI since ICO(01.03.2017)made +5300% only in 5 months. With this in mind looks likethere is some serious money to be made in this market by investors in a relatively short period of time but of course they must keep in mind that volatility is a two-way street and prices can drop sharply as well. The second reason why VCs are becoming more interested in blockchain ICOs is because of their liquidity . Instead of waiting for the long play like in a traditional IPO or an acquisition they can realize gains more quickly and can pull profits out more easily. They just simply need to convert their cryptocurrencies into any major FIAT currency by a trustworthy crypto-exchange. What traditional investors don’t like about the blockchain space? · regulatory uncertainty · lack of control over financials & strategy · scams & pump and dumps “Strict regulation comparable to the IPO business to protect investors is required,” Oliver Bussmann, a former CIO at UBS and now Bussmann Advisory, Crypto Valley Association, Innovate Finance However scams and criminal activities being reduced by due diligence of the community as well as by external parties using independent analytical research. So who are those VCs backing blockchain startups? Billionaire bitcoin enthusiast and Venture Capitalist Tim Draper backed Tezos and Bancor as well this year which were the two biggest ICOs yet and Marc Cuban, NBA’s Dallas Mavericks owner and serial entrepreneur is planning to invest in an ICO campaign run by eSports gambling startup UniKrn. “I want to learn more about them. I haven’t signed the paperwork yet. But it’s likely it will happen,” said Cuban. Some other VCs have stepped into the space as well like Blockchain Capital (BCAP, ICO), Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures who are leading the crypto movements by investing $10 million into a crypto hedge fund run by Olaf Carlson-Wee called Polychain Capital and investing in Coinbase the early days. I believe VCs, rather than replaced by ICOs, could actually find a productive relationship and benefit from each other. Companies who choose the ICO way could use it as a seed round and then they would be in a better position to negotiate their next round. Which means that ICOs could be more like a crowdfunding part of a company and the venture capital round would come later.

  "title": "Mark Cuban is trying to fix social media's biggest problems by backing a company mixing bitcoin technology with messaging",
  "text": "print \nFamed investor Mark Cuban is a key advisor on Mercury Protocol. Slaven Vlasic / Stringer / Getty Images \nA Mark Cuban-backed company is looking to take on social media giants like Facebook with the development of a new communication technology built on blockchain, the key technology behind the cryptocurrency bitcoin. \nCuban is an advisor on the project along with Nick Tomaino, an early employee at the cryptocurrency unicorn Coinbase. \nThe project, Mercury Protocol, is essentially a way to send messages over social media using blockchain technology. It's housed under the company Radical App LLC, of which Cuban is an investor. \nThe developers say that Mercury Protocol will increase user privacy and security, in part because blockchain anonymizes user identity. Behavioral data won't be linked to individuals and sold to advertisers, the way it currently is on social networking platforms like Facebook and Twitter. \nLike all blockchains, it's also decentralized and lives across a network of computers, rather than a single server. This means it's more secure, because attackers would have to compromise the majority of the network, instead of just one access point. \nIn September, the project team will attempt to raise funding through an initial coin offering for a new cryptocurrency called global messaging token. Initial coin offerings, or ICOs, are a way of crowdfunding projects in exchange for tokens. Some of those tokens act like money. Others, like the global messaging token, can be used on platforms in exchange for services. \nThe team behind the project wrote in a release that users will be able to earn tokens by performing platform-specific actions such as reading a set number of posts, or by creating content. The tokens can be exchanged for premium services, and other in-app bonuses. \nMercury Protocol also has a way to address the trolls and bag eggs commonly found on websites like Twitter. The blockchain will include what the team calls \"r eputation points for positive interactions\" — services will cost more tokens for people that act like jerks. \n\"Similar to a credit score or insurance claim history, users with weaker reputation score may be charged higher premiums while users with a stronger reputation will be charged a lower premium,\" the team wrote. \nMercury Protocol is already being developed by the existing team at Dust, a self-destructing messaging platform, which is also part of Radical App LLC. The protocol will be integrated into Dust in the next couple of weeks. \nIn theory, Mercury Protocol is platform-agnostic, and, if it takes off, could feasibly be integrated into other popular social media platforms. More realistically, however, new communication platforms will be built on top of the protocol. Because blockchains keep a comprehensive receipt of everything that's ever happened on it, new platforms will have the entire history of messages as well. It will also be possible to communicate across multiple platforms. \nThere are also plans to put it on a new platform called Broadcast. Broadcast is being developed by the same team and is expected to launch by the end of the 2017. The aim of Broadcast is to counter the curated social media feeds that are common in today's world, and encourage people with differing views to discuss topics live. \nCritics often describe the current social media space as an echo-chamber, by which people only hear opinions that reinforce their world view. \nIt's been reported that Cuban is looking to buy back the domain name Broadcast.com, which he sold to Yahoo in 1999 as an internet radio company. The domain currently reroutes to the Yahoo homepage. Get the latest Bitcoin price here. ",

  "text": "CYBERCRIMES ‘Game of Thrones’ Finale Info Released by HBO Hackers Mysterious hackers who have been holding HBO hostage have released more private company information, including contracts, script outlines, social media logins, and more. Marlow Stern 08.26.17 2:24 AM ET \nIt’s been a summer of highs and lows for HBO. While their critically acclaimed fantasy epic Game of Thrones has achieved record viewership, some of which has spilled over to its other shows Insecure and Ballers , the premium cable network’s been targeted by a shadowy cabal of hackers who have been holding it hostage. \nBack on July 30, The Daily Beast—along with numerous other media outlets—received a mysterious email from an anonymous account with the headline, “1.5 TB of HBO data just leaked!!!” The body of the email read as follows: “The greatest leak of cyber space era is happening. What’s its name? Oh I forgot to tell. Its HBO and Game of Thrones…… You are lucky to be the first pioneers to witness and download the leak. Enjoy it & spread the words. Whoever spreads well, we will have an interview with him.” At the bottom of the message, it directed all enquiries to a specific HBO executive—leading some to surmise that the perpetrator(s) could consist of at least one disgruntled former employee. \nThe email directed to a website (that has since been taken down) that included some of the contents of the 1.5 TB of information that had been stolen from HBO, including two yet-to-be-aired Game of Thrones episodes, internal company documents, and more. \nAccording to CNBC , in order to stop the leaks, “The hackers demanded money [in bitcoin] worth six months of their salary, claiming they make $12 million to $15 million from stealing intellectual property and blackmailing companies. Those hackers appear to have been engaged in email correspondence with HBO.” An email obtained by CNBC that was sent from HBO to the hackers on July 27 read: “As a show of good faith on our side, we are willing to commit to making a bug bounty payment of $250,000 to you as soon as we can establish the necessary account and acquire bitcoin.” \nHBO has refused to give in to the cyberterrorists’ demands, so the leaks have continued—including dozens of personal emails from executives, and entire unaired episodes of shows, including three episodes of Game of Thrones , two episodes of Insecure , pilot episodes to the upcoming series The Deuce and Barry , two episodes of the upcoming season of Curb Your Enthusiasm , and more. \nIn the early hours Saturday morning, the hackers sent what they are calling the “6th wave” of leaks to media outlets, consisting of contractual information for the stars of Game of Thrones’ seventh season, as well as episode summaries and script outlines for the entire seventh season of Thrones —including the unaired seventh episode (and season finale) airing this Sunday, and login/password information for HBO’s social media pages, including all of its hit shows. Furthermore, the hackers have threatened to release the Game of Thrones finale episode. \nThe social media info leak comes on the heels of HBO’s social media pages—including Facebook and Twitter—being hacked on August 16 by a security hacking group that calls itself OurMine. Social media accounts for HBO, Game of Thrones , Last Week Tonight with John Oliver , and various other programs all displayed the message, “Hi, OurMine are here, we are just testing your security, HBO team please contact us to upgrade the security.” The group followed it up with posts that read, “let’s make #HBOHacked trending!” \nIt is not yet known whether the two hacks are related. \n“We successfully breached into your huge network,” the hackers behind the initial breach said in a video message inserted in one of the data dumps. “HBO was one of our difficult targets to deal with but we succeeded (it took about 6 months).” READ THIS LIST ",

  "text": "Hackers Have Gone and Leaked Details of How 'Game of Thrones' Season 7 Ends By Julia Pimentel News + Pop Culture | @julia_rdsp\n Image via HBO This current Game of Thrones season, which also happens to be the second to last season of the show, has been an explosive one, but it has also been riddled with hacks from the very beginning. One of the most devastating hacks was perpetrated by an anonymous hacker who calls themselves Mr. Smith.\nThis particular hack stole over 1.5 terabytes of data from HBO, and they’ve been releasing the information to the public in waves. But now the hack has reached its grand finale: they’ve leaked the end of Game of Thrones season 7.\nThe hacker(s) claim to have released the plot summary and outline of the end of season 7. In a previous statement , HBO refused to comment directly on the hacks, instead acknowledging that \"the hacker may continue to drop bits and pieces of stolen information in an attempt to generate media attention,\" but finally concluding “that’s a game we’re not going to participate in.\"\nThe hackers initially demanded $6 million in Bitcoin to stop the hack, and although HBO appeared initially to be willing to negotiate , it does not seem like the hackers accepted the deal.\nAccording to Mashable , Mr. Smith also claim to have sold all of the data they stole form HBO, which they claim adds up to five terabytes instead of 1.5, to three paying customers on the dark web for half of the $6 million they originally asked for.\nIn an email to Mashable , the hackers seemed proud and excited by their achievements.\n\"By the way, we officially inform you and other hundred of reporters whom emailing us that we sold &apos;HBO IS FALLING&apos;s entire collection (5 TB!!!) to 3 customer in deep web and we earned half of requested ransom. We put a condition for our respected customers and they approved. We will leak many many waves of HBO&apos;s internal stuff to punish them for playing us and set an example of greedy corporation.\"\n\"Game of throne is over,\" the hacker(s) added in the email. \"Wait for major waves!!!

  "title": "Ecstasy could be a breakthrougha therapy for soldiers, others suffering from PTSD",
  "text": "August 26 at 6:04 PM Follow @thewanreport For Jon Lubecky, the scars on his wrists are a reminder of the years he spent in mental purgatory.\nHe returned from an Army deployment in Iraq a broken man. He heard mortar shells and helicopters where there were none. He couldn’t sleep and drank until he passed out. He got every treatment offered by Veterans Affairs for post-traumatic stress disorder. But they didn’t stop him from trying to kill himself — five times.\nFinally, he signed up for an experimental therapy and was given a little green capsule. The anguish stopped.\nInside that pill was a compound named MDMA, better known by dealers and rave partygoers as ecstasy. That street drug is emerging as the most promising tool to come along in years for the military’s escalating PTSD epidemic.\nThe MDMA program was created by a small group of psychedelic researchers who had toiled for years in the face of ridicule, funding shortages and skepticism. But the results have been so positive that this month the Food and Drug Administration deemed it a “ breakthrough therapy ” — setting it on a fast track for review and potential approval.\nA dose of MDMA in the office of South Carolina psychiatrist Michael Mithoefer, who has studied its use as a treatment for PTSD. (Travis Dove/For The Washington Post) The prospect of a government-sanctioned psychedelic drug has generated both excitement and concern. And it has opened the door to scientists studying new uses for other illegal psychedelics like LSD and psilocybin (commonly known as magic mushrooms).\n“We’re in this odd situation where one of the most promising therapies also happens to be a Schedule 1 substance banned by the [Drug Enforcement Administration],” said retired Brig. Gen. Loree Sutton, who until 2010 was the highest ranking psychiatrist in the U.S. Army.\nBecause of the stigma attached to psychedelics since the trippy 1960s, many military and government leaders still hesitate to embrace them. Some scientists are also wary of the nonprofit spearheading ecstasy therapy, a group with the stated goal of making the banned drugs part of mainstream culture.\nBut the scope and severity of PTSD makes it all irrelevant, said Sutton, who now works as New York City’s commissioner of veteran services. “If this is something that could really save lives, we need to run and not walk toward it. We need to follow the data.”\nPTSD has been a problem for the military for decades, but America’s recent wars have pushed it to epidemic-level heights. Experts estimate between 11 and 20 percent of soldiers who served in Iraq or Afghanistan suffer from PTSD.\nThe affliction is typically triggered after experiencing or witnessing violence, including assault and abuse. It has ravaged lives and broken up marriages. It often leaves its victims in sudden panic and prevents them from dealing with the original trauma.\nAnd that last symptom is what makes PTSD particularly hard to overcome with traditional talk therapy. Because patients can’t talk about and process the trauma, experts say, it lingers like a poison in their mind.\nRick Doblin founded a nonprofit advocating research into the therapeutic use of psychedelic drugs. (Nirvan Mullick) Only two drugs are approved for treating PTSD: Zoloft and Paxil. Both have proved largely ineffective when it comes to veterans, whose cases are especially difficult to resolve because of their prolonged or repeated exposure to combat.\n“If you’re a combat veteran with multiple tours of duty, the chance of a good response to these drugs is one in three, maybe lower,” said John Krystal, chairman of psychiatry at Yale University and a director at the VA’s National Center for PTSD. “That’s why there’s so much frustration and interest in finding something that works better.”\nEcstasy has long been a favorite at trance parties and raves because of its unique ability to flood users with intense feelings of euphoria. But as a byproduct, it also reduces fear and imbues users with a deep sense of love and acceptance of themselves and others — the perfect conditions for trauma therapy.\nBy giving doses of MDMA at the beginning of three, eight-hour therapy sessions, researchers say they have helped chronic PTSD patients process and move past their traumas.\nIn clinical trials with 107 patients closely monitored by the FDA, 61 percent reported major reductions in symptoms — to the point where they no longer fit the criteria for PTSD. Follow-up studies a year later found 67 percent no longer had PTSD.\n“If you were to design the perfect drug to treat PTSD, MDMA would be it,” said Rick Doblin, who three decades ago founded the California nonprofit behind the clinical trials.\nIt is no accident that the group — the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) — chose PTSD as its argument for ending the government’s ban on psychedelics.\n“We wanted to help a population that would automatically win public sympathy,” he said. “No one’s going to argue against the need to help them.”\nDoblin, now 63, talks openly about his own history with drugs. He began tripping on LSD as a rebellious, long-haired college freshman in the 1970s. He says it helped him see the world and himself in new ways. He wanted to become a therapist and use psychedelics to help others achieve similar insights, but he couldn’t because LSD was already banned.\n“The flaw of the early psychedelic movement was that they made it countercultural, a revolution,” he said. “Culture is dominant. Culture is always going to win.”\nFor a decade, he worked in construction until he came across MDMA for the first time. When the DEA moved to criminalize it in 1984, Doblin created MAPS and sued the agency. The lawsuit failed, and Doblin realized that psychedelics were perceived as too fringe to win public support.\nTo succeed, he decided, both he and the issue had to go mainstream.\nDoblin talked his way into the public policy PhD program at Harvard University and learned to navigate the federal bureaucracy. He shaved off his mustache, cut his shaggy hair and learned to dress up.\n“I used to laugh about how simple it was,” he said. “You put on a suit, and suddenly everyone thinks you’re fine.”\nThe external switch reflected an internal one as well. Instead of fighting government officials, he began plotting to win them over, especially those at the FDA.\nAnd the key, he realized, was science.\n****\nBefore the FDA would even talk about clinical trials for MDMA, the agency needed proof it wasn’t dangerous. Previous studies suggesting its neurotoxicity had been limited to rats. So in 1986, Doblin scraped together money to buy monkeys for those same researchers, who found the risks to be much less at human-equivalent doses than previously thought.\nThe next step was investigating MDMA’s effects on people. Doblin again raised money to fly psychedelic users he had befriended to Stanford University and Johns Hopkins University for spinal taps. The studies were approved by review boards at both institutions. Doblin also participated, undergoing two spinal taps.\nIn the two decades that followed, Doblin and MAPS inched toward progress.\nThe nonprofit grew from a one-man band to a staff of 25 with headquarters in Santa Cruz. It tapped into the scene in Silicon Valley — where many tech entrepreneurs have used psychedelics to spark creativity. (Steve Jobs famously praised LSD as “one of the two or three most important things I have done in my life.”)\nMAPS received a $5.5 million bequest from the founder of a software company. The hipster soap company Dr. Bronner’s pledged $5 million. A professional poker player who attributed his wins to microdosing on LSD gave $25,000. Recently, an anonymous $21,000 bitcoin donation came in.\nMuch of that money funded small-scale clinical trials, which laid the groundwork for the last remaining hurdle: Large-scale “phase 3” trials that will begin next year, involving 200 to 300 patients in 14 locations.\nIf those future trials yield similar results, the FDA could approve the MDMA treatment for PTSD as soon as 2021, according to Doblin.\nYet his dream extends beyond that. He envisions a future where psychedelic treatment centers are in every city — places people can visit for enhanced couples therapy, spiritual experiences and personal growth. He believes psychedelics can help address the country’s biggest problems, from homelessness and war to global warming.\n“These drugs are a tool that can make people more compassionate, tolerant, more connected with other humans and the planet itself,” he said.\nThat kind of talk makes many in the medical community nervous.\nIt’s hard to measure the exact dangers of ecstasy. Because it is not used as widely as marijuana or cocaine, for example, fewer statistics are available on overdoses or injuries. In 2011, a public health monitoring system identified 22,498 emergency department visits nationwide related to ecstasy.\nMDMA researchers point out that one key difference between MDMA and street ecstasy (along with another variant called “molly”) is the street versions often contain other harmful drugs, experts say. Sometimes the pills don’t even contain MDMA.\nBut even in its purest clinical form, MDMA can pose risks . At high doses, it can cause the body to overheat. It can cause anxiety and increase the stress hormone cortisol. Chronic use can also cause memory impairment.\n“I think it’s a dangerous substance,” said Andrew Parrott, a psychology professor at Swansea University in Wales who spent years researching the drug’s harmful effects. He worries FDA approval for the treatment of PTSD could lead many in the public to believe ecstasy is safe for recreational use.\nOther experts, however, have become increasingly intrigued by its promising results.\n“Anytime you have an organization that is advocating for drugs that are illegal, it marginalizes them in the research field. MAPS still isn’t seen as mainstream. But it’s possible they have a point here,” said Krystal, the Yale psychiatrist, who has not been involved with the group’s research. “I can’t think of a single medication that doesn’t carry some side effect. The question here is whether the benefits outweigh the risk.”",

  "title": "Understanding blockchain technology, bitcoins and the rise of cryptocurrency",
  "text": "\nBI Intelligence What is blockchain technology? \nFor the past several weeks, you've likely heard some of the following terms if you've paid attention to the world of finance: Cryptocurrency, Blockchain, Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Ethereum. But what do they mean? And why is cryptocurrency suddenly so hot? \nFirst, we'll explain the blockchain basics. As society become increasingly digital, financial services providers are looking to offer customers the same services to which they're accustomed, but in a more efficient, secure, and cost effective way. Enter blockchain technology. The origins of blockchain are a bit nebulous. A person or group of people known by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakomoto invented and released the tech in 2009 as a way to digitally and anonymously send payments between two parties without needing a third party to verify the transaction. It was initially designed to facilitate, authorize, and log the transfer of bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies. How does blockchain technology work? Blockchain tech is actually rather easy to understand at its core. Essentially, it's a shared database populated with entries that must be confirmed and encrypted. Think of it as a kind of highly encrypted and verified shared Google Document, in which each entry in the sheet depends on a logical relationship to all its predecessors. Blockchain tech offers a way to securely and efficiently create a tamper-proof log of sensitive activity (anything from international money transfers to shareholder records). Blockchain's conceptual framework and underlying code is useful for a variety of financial processes because of the potential it has to give companies a secure, digital alternative to banking processes that are typically bureaucratic, time-consuming, paper-heavy, and expensive. FILE PHOTO:An illustration photo of Bitcoin (virtual currency) coins are seen at La Maison du Bitcoin in Paris Thomson Reuters What are cryptocurrencies? \nCryptocurrencies are essentially just digital money, digital tools of exchange that use cryptography and the aforementioned blockchain technology to facilitate secure and anonymous transactions. There had been several iterations of cryptocurrency over the years, but Bitcoin truly thrust cryptocurrencies forward in the late 2000s. There are thousands of cryptocurrencies floating out on the market now, but Bitcoin is far and away the most popular. How do you mine cryptocurrency? \nBitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies don't just fall out of the sky. Like any other form of money, it takes work to produce them. And that work comes in the form of mining. \nBut let's take a step back. Satoshi Nakamoto, the founder of Bitcoin, ensured that there would ever only be 21 million Bitcoins in existence. He (or they) reached that figure by calculating that people would discover, or \"mine,\" a certain number of blocks of transactions each day. \nEvery four years, the number of Bitcoins released in relation to the previous cycle gets reduced by 50%, along with the reward to miners for discovering new blocks. At the moment, that reward is 12.5 Bitcoins. Therefore, the total number of Bitcoins in circulation will approach 21 million but never actually reach that figure. This means Bitcoin will never experience inflation. The downside here is that a hack or cyberattack could be a disaster because it could erase Bitcoin wallets with little hope of getting the value back. \nAs for mining Bitcoins, the process requires electrical energy. Miners solve complex mathematical problems, and the reward is more Bitcoins generated and awarded to them. Miners also verify transactions and prevent fraud, so more miners equals faster, more reliable, and more secure transactions. \nThanks to Satoshi Nakamoto's designs, Bitcoin mining becomes more difficult as more miners join the fray. In 2009, a miner could mine 200 Bitcoin in a matter of days. In 2014, it would take approximately 98 years to mine just one, according to 99Bitcoins . \nSuper powerful computers called Application Specific Integrated Circuit, or ASIC, were developed specifically to mine Bitcoins. But because so many miners have joined in the last few years, it remains difficult to mine loads. The solution is mining pools, groups of miners who band together and are paid relative to their share of the work. \nBI Intelligence Current & future uses of blockchain technology & cryptocurrency \nSince its inception, Bitcoin has been rather volatile. But based on its recent boom — and a forecast by Snapchat's first investor, Jeremy Liew, that it would hit $500,000 by 2030 — and the prospect of grabbing a slice of the Bitcoin pie becomes far more attractive. \nBitcoin users expect 94% of all bitcoins to be released by 2024. As the number moves toward the ceiling of 21 million, many expect the profits miners once made from the creation of new blocks to become so low that they will become negligible. But as more bitcoins enter circulation, transaction fees could rise and offset this. \nAs for blockchain technology itself, it has numerous applications, from banking to the Internet of Things. In the next few years, BI Intelligence expects companies to flesh out their blockchain IoT solutions.

  "title": "Bitcoin and Artificial Intelligence Can Help Fight Sex Trafficking",
  "text": "Computer science researchers at the University of California, Berkeley have developed new tools to identify sex trafficking rings, making them easier for law enforcement to target and prosecute. Those efforts have been stymied, according to the researchers’ report, by the vast quantity of ads for sex posted to websites like Backpage.com, only a portion of which may point to human trafficking or sex slavery. Screening thousands of new ads every day can also take a mental toll on human workers. The new technique, developed by a team including PhD candidate Rebecca S. Portnoff, combines two distinct approaches to solving that problem. First, the team created a machine-learning filter that finds stylistic similarities between ads for sex services posted to sites like Backpage.com. That makes it easier to distinguish between women voluntarily engaging in sex work, and those being forced into it by criminal organizations posting multiple ads. The second technique goes even deeper. Because Backpage is the most used portal for advertising sex services, credit card processors like Visa refused to service the site starting in 2015. That left Bitcoin as the preferred means of paying for ads. The Berkeley researchers took advantage of Bitcoin’s public blockchain — a record of all transactions — to identify payments for sex ads originating with the same Bitcoin user, again providing evidence of a larger organization and likelihood of trafficking. Those linkages could be used to subpoena further records from Bitcoin wallet services, or to expand on sting operations conducted using phone numbers or other contact information listed in the ads. Bitcoin was initially hailed as an anonymous way of paying for services, making it hugely popular among users of Darknet markets like Silk Road and, later, AlphaBay. But law enforcement and cybersecurity researchers have shown that it’s not hard to track and trace Bitcoin transactions, and even to connect them to real-world names. That has helped bring down dark markets, while also spurring the development of less traceable cryptocurrencies like Monero and Zcash. The Berkeley researchers said that, after encouraging tests, NGOs, companies, and law enforcement agencies are either already using, planning to use, or expressing strong interest in the new techniques.

  "text": "Bitcoin market cap at $70 billion \nBy Anora Mahmudova Reporter \nBitcoin rose modestly on Thursday as the most prominent digital currency recovers from recent sharp declines that briefly put it into correction territory. \nMoves for the cyber monetary unit come as Securities and Exchange Commission temporarily suspended trading in the shares of First Bitcoin Capital Corp. BITCF, +4.68% because of concerns about the accuracy and adequacy of public information on the Canadian company. \nStill, a single bitcoin BTCUSD, +2.09% rose 2.3% to $4,287.64, advancing for a third straight day, according to Coindesk.com data , and sending its total market value to about $70 billion, according to digital-currency research site Coinmarketcap.com. \nDespite recent advances, the digital currency, is still about 5% below its record set on Aug. 17, though year to date, it is up more than 300%. \nBitcoin prices have been volatile, largely due to issues surrounding the need to increase transaction sizes in the blockchain network. Traditional bitcoin participants agreed on a new protocol known as Segregated Witness, or SegWit., which they believe solves bitcoin’s scaling issue. \nThe adoption of SegWit hasn’t been smooth, with a minority of users rejecting it, leading to the split of bitcoin that created Bitcoin Cash. \nOn Thursday, the price of Bitcoin Cash fell 1.6% to 649.32, bringing its market cap to $10.7 billion. \nEther tokens, the chief rival to bitcoin, which runs on the Ethereum network, was little changed on Thursday at $323.74. Ether on Wednesday rose 0.4% to $325, its highest level since June 23. While it remains below an all-time intraday high above $400 hit on June 12, it has more than doubled from a recent intraday low hit in mid-July. For 2017, it is up about 4,000%, bringing its market cap to $30.6 billion. \nRead : This bitcoin $25,000 call is more proof of the cybercurrency bubble \nThe recent advances in bitcoin, along with the recovery in Ether, brought the total market capitalization of all cryprtocurrencies above $150 billion. The basket of cybercurrencies tracked by Coinmarketcap.com first broke above $100 billion in early June, meaning the space has risen by half in a little more than two months. \nMeanwhile, shares of Firtst Bitcoin Capital Corp traded at $1.79 before its halt. The stock traded at $0.05 at the start of the year and gained more than 6,000% year to date. \nFirst Bitcoin Capital Corp. is a Canadian corporation that invests in companies that mine bitcoin and operates exchanges and digital wallets, according to their website. The suspension was effective Thursday 9:30 Eastern Tim until noon Sept. 7. \nIn other news, A regulatory arm of Canada on Thursday signaled a warning about so-called initial coin offerings, or ICOs , which have spiked in popularity. The Canadian Securities Administrator, although acknowledging the benefits of raising funds by digital tokens, it said there are big risks . \n“However, they can also raise investor protection concerns, due to issues around volatility, transparency, valuation, custody and liquidity, as well as the use of unregulated cryptocurrency exchanges.Also, investors may be harmed by unethical practices or illegal schemes, and may not understand the properties of the investment products that they are purchasing,” the CSA said, adding that it was monitoring developments in ICOs .

  "text": "An elderly woman was seen clutching a \"CRA Legal Notice\" and feeding a large amount of cash into a Bitcoin ATM in a local convenience store on Thursday.\n\nSomeone else in the store noticed what was going on and called police, believing her to be the victim of a scam.\n\nHamilton police showed up and answered the woman's phone when it rang.\nThe scammer went as far as masking his or her own phone number, and it appeared on the woman's phone like the number of the person calling was 905-546-4925 – the non-emergency line of the Hamilton police. The person on the other end of the phone said she was \"Mary Jones\" of Hamilton police.\n\nPolice found out that the woman had deposited almost $17,000 into Bitcoin machines in the area in a matter of days, said Det. Sgt. Greg Doerr, who oversees the police major fraud unit.\n\n\"The reality is that it's going to be a very hard investigation,\" Doerr said. \"Once you transfer money into Bitcoin it's very hard to track where it went.\"\n\nOften embarrassment about being contacted by the CRA or the government keeps people from telling their families – but even just asking someone else if the letter seemed legit might have saved this woman from the scam.\n\n\"Nobody believes they will ever fall victim to such a scam but many people do,\" police remind in a press release about the incident.\n\n\"Some people are more susceptible to deceptive tactics and we need to make sure they are aware of these fraudsters.\"\n\nThey emphasize that no official government or administrative centre will ever ask you to pay using Bitcoin ATM, iTunes or Steam cards, other prepaid gift cards, or wired money through Western Union.\n\nThey also won't text you or use as intimidating and \"high-pressure\" tactics, police say.\n\nDoerr said police will be tracing the calls and emails that the woman received and trying to find a lead on the investigation. But he emphasized that the more people who know about these scams happening, the less likely they are to succeed.",

Burger King Russia Introduces The \"Whoppercoin\" - The Fast-Food Industry's First Digital Currency Aug 26, 2017 8:05 PM 0 SHARES \nIn what we believe to be a first for the global fast-food industry, Burger King Russia has reportedly created a virtual currency called the “Whoppercoin.” \nThe company has reportedly issued one billion of the tokens using the Waves blockchain platform. According to Fortune, the coin was launched alongside a new loyalty program: For every Whopper purchased, customers will receive one Whoppercoin. However, it’s unclear if the company will accept the digital tokens as payment. \n“The Whoppercoin launched in tandem with a new loyalty program. For each Whopper burger customers purchase, they'll receive one Whoppercoin in a special cryptocurrency wallet. While the coins’ wider use is unclear, some reports suggest that the Whoppercoin will be accepted as payment at Burger Kings across Russia.” \nBurger King’s decision comes amid a thaw in Russia’s posture toward digital currencies. After initially threatening to jail digital-currency users, the Russian government is reportedly considering legislation to legalize digital-currency payments. Earlier this month, an aid to Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that he would be seeking to raise $100 million to build a large bitcoin-mining operation with the goal of eventually claiming 30% of the bitcoin network’s hashing power. \nThe Whoppercoin was officially introduced on Aug. 22. Its introduction followed reports earlier this summer that Burger King Russia was planning to start accepting payment in bitcoin. ",

  "text": "Nvidia's boost from cryptocurrencies is slowing down Seth Archer Aug 24, 2017, 08.20 PM Continue reading Nvidia on YouTube \nNvidia is among the companies seeing a boost from the cryptocurrency craze, but, that boost has been slowing down recently. \nIn its second quarter earnings repor t, Nvidia said it saw a $150 million boost from miners buying its chips to help mine cryptocurrencies, like Ethereum. During that quarter, the speed of the network increased by about 55 terahashes per second, according to Mitch Steves, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. \nSteves says the network is not growing as fast this quarter, which would mean fewer miners are buying cards and the boost from cryptocurrency mining will not be as large for the company in the current quarter. \nSo far, in the third quarter, the network has only increased about 15 terahashes per second, which implies a boost of about $40 to $45 million for Nvidia. The network speed increases as more cards from Nvidia and other companies are added to the network. Miners have been scrambling to grab as many cards as possible in order to speed up the network, and win a bigger share of the reward given for payment verifications. The rapid demand means Nvidia's cards have been sold out in a lot of retailers recently. \nA shift in the way the Ethereum network verifies payments could come as early as this year, according to Steves. That shift would move payment verification away from the power-hungry \"proof of work\" method to a \"proof of stake\" system. The new system, if implemented, would dramatically lessen the need for powerful chips from Nvidia, and by extension, lessen the boost the company has seen from cryptocurrencies. \nNvidia is paying attention to cryptocurrencies and sees it as an important part of its business, but its real bets are being placed elsewhere. The company just released a new chip architecture called \"Volta\" which has been popular in datacenter and machine learning applications. Volta production is still ramping up, and the chips are new to the market leaving lots of room for that segment to grow, Steves said. \nThe company also has partnered with carmakers Toyota and Volvo to help the companies' autonomous driving efforts. Steves believes this is another part of the business that will continue to grow in the future. \n\"Crypto isn't dead yet,\" Steves wrote. Ethereum, bitcoin and bitcoin cash have all exploded in value this year , but the hype for the currencies might eventually leave Nvidia behind. \nSteves rates Nvidia a buy with a price target of $175. \nNvidia is up 62.99% this year, and is trading at about $166.11.",

Antony Executive Director, Cyber India; Vice President, Navoothan Foundation Adnan1 Abidi / Reuters ADVERTISEMENT The declaration by a nine-member Supreme Court bench that privacy is a fundamental right guaranteed by the Constitution is a body blow to the government initiative of mandatorily linking the biometric identity program, Aadhaar, to our national databases, financial transactions, essential services and welfare schemes.\nNotwithstanding the jubilation among the rights petitioners, this landmark ruling is just another step in the right direction, with several more required to ascertain citizens' privacy in the ongoing digital era. It's also important that India, a nation with one of the highest terror and cyber-threat perceptions, should look into any major legislative drafting from a national security perspective.\nPrivacy concerns weakening the ability of our counter-terrorism and intelligence units to stay a step ahead in the darkening digital world would have grave long-term consequences. In this data-driven digital age, our every action, our every smart device (including mobile phones and personal computers) and our every application (including social media platforms and web browsers) generate humongous volume of information—ranging from our personal likes and dislikes, to our personal connections, to our financial transaction records, to our shopping, travel and hospital records—with or without our knowledge.\nComplex algorithms could easily bring together seemingly innocuous impersonal information to create unique personal profiles of any individual. Strong data protection and privacy laws, similar to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) , set to be introduced in the European Union from the May of 2018 are imperative to ensure that we have control over our own data, and for us to decide with whom we share our personal information.\nThat being said, we should not forget that our current times are seeing an exponential increase in cyber crimes, with the internet used as a primary tool for several antisocial activities ranging from smuggling, trafficking and money laundering to recruitment into terror outfits.\nTerrorist organisations such as ISIS are believed to have started using digital cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoins as the preferred funding mechanism to covertly expand their operations. Data breaches and identity thefts allow a perpetrator to execute any of the above-mentioned activities, with the onus on victims to prove their innocence.\nPrivacy concerns weakening the ability of our counter-terrorism and intelligence units to stay a step ahead in the darkening digital world would have grave long-term consequences.\nFurthermore, measures taken to curb the efforts of the government to collect and analyse data, the primary raw material of our digital economy—while a handful of private corporations colonise the bulk of the planet's generated data—would undermine the state's ability to provide quality citizen services, which in turn could create turbulent social and economic disruptions.\nThe creation of independent watchdog institutions... with ample constitutional authority to ensure that any public or private organisation working with data complies with stringent data privacy, protection and security regulations, would be ideal... However, unchecked and unaccounted data collection and examination, especially by government entities would lay the foundations of a dreaded police and surveillance state, the primary fear of the rights petitioners who have challenged the mandatory Aadhaar push.\nThe creation of independent watchdog institutions akin to the Election Commission, preferably answerable to a parliamentary committee, with ample constitutional authority to oversee and ensure that any public or private organisation working with data complies with stringent data privacy, protection and security regulations, would be ideal steps to ensure that our citizens effectively preserve their privacy in the digital age.\nMale Child Abuse Survivors Male Child Abuse Survivors 1 of 5 Share this slide:",

And, really, it’s not even close, according to the latest chart from cost-estimating website HowMuch.net .\nAs you can see below, the x-axis represents annual hours worked and the y-axis represents annual GDP per capita in U.S. dollars. Shades of blue illustrate the countries with relatively high worker productivity, while the red-shaded countries lag in that respect. The data comes from the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.\nWestern nations dominate the list of most productive countries. In fact, they take 30 of the top 36 spots. Leading the way, Luxembourg gets $68.47 in productivity out of each person per hour worked. Norway and Switzerland aren’t far behind.\nThe U.S., where workers average 33.6 hours on the job each week, comes in at $34.02. Workers in Luxembourg, by comparison, log 29 hours a week.\nGermany earns a special distinction as the country that works the fewest hours but still manages to score highly in terms of productivity.\nOn the other end of the spectrum, Mexico works the longest hours but doesn’t have nearly as much to show for it. The same can be said for Costa Rica.\n We just might be in a bitcoin bubble when...

  "text": "PR professional. CMO @HiveProject_net. ICO adviser. Working on interesting projects and political campaigns. Aug 25 Hive Token (HVN) DISTRIBUTION As mentioned in our previous blog, we managed to raise a grand total of BTC 2,087 from 2,234 contributors during the 6 weeks of our ICO. Full details of how the HVN tokens will be distributed are on our website and have been detailed in various blogs and on our official channels. Recap: The total number of tokens is 500,000,000, which is final (no new HVN token will ever be issued) and will be divided as follows: 2% (10,000,000 tokens) has been allocated to early marketing supporters (bounty campaign) and will be distributed after we distribute the HVN tokens to all 2,234 contributors. 3% (15,000,000) has been allocated for the user growth pool (integrating the Hive Project platform with local ERPs). 20% (100,000,000 tokens) has been allocated for the continued development of the Hive platform , ensuring the long-term motivation of the Hive Project team and maximising returns for contributors. 75% (375,000,000) has been allocated to the Hive Project ICO’s contributors. How many tokens should I get? The total number of HVN tokens you get is determined by the amount and timing of your investment, which determines the bonus to which you are entitled. We are distributing 375,000,000 HVN tokens to contribuors, which are divided by the weighted sum of all the contributions — with the relevant bonus coefficient applied. When determining the number of tokens, the bonus scheme applies. As has been clearly explained throughout the ICO, an investment of 1 bitcoin made during the first week will not have the same weight as if it was invested during the last week! The formula to use when calculating the number of HVN tokens to which you are entitled is as follows: Here is a real life example of a calculation made by the girlfriend of one of our team members. She contributed BTC 0.968 with a 0% bonus (on week 6). Feel free to use the same calculation to double check the number of HVN tokens you have been allocated. What now? As soon as all of the HVN tokens are distributed to our contributors and bounty participants, we will announce the exchanges where HVN will be listed … stay tuned for updates as and when they emerge!

  "title": "ICOs are the future of raising money",
  "text": "252 shares \nMagnitogorsk, Russia is not exactly known as a venture capital hotspot, but that didn’t stop a zirconium manufacturer based there from successfully raising $7 million from 4,000 investors. All it took to raise the money necessary to start their (extremely specific) business was a thoughtful deployment of the initial coin offering. \nPerpetually shortened as “ICO,” an initial coin offering is a crowdfunding mechanism built on top of the blockchain , the same open-source software technology that powers Bitcoin , Ethereum , and other cryptocurrencies. Instead of conventional cryptocurrency, ICO investors buy “tokens” that represent partial ownership of a company’s cashflow. A token’s value goes up or down based on the company’s financials, and investors trade these assets at a profit or loss as they see fit. \nThe ICO market is perhaps fairly contextualized as an unregulated, blockchain-enabled stock market. There’s no centralized exchange for tracking every ICO in one place, but a number of sites work to monitor upcoming and in-progress ICOs. First appearing in 2014 , ICO’s are acquiring breakthrough momentum; So far in 2017, some 92 companies have raised more than $1.2 billion via initial coin offering, and an ecosystem of ICO-related startups have cropped up to take things mainstream. \nLately leading this charge is a Moscow-based company called Waves . Its platform serves to facilitate ICO token sales from scratch; whether you want to start a large enterprise business, a small mom-and-pop shop, or something in between, Waves exists to make it quick and easy to raise money on the blockchain. It even raised $16 million of crowdfunding using its own technology . \n“[The ICO is] a very flexible instrument,” says Waves CEO Sasha Ivanov. “It’s more cost-effective [than other fundraising] because you cut out the middleman and go directly to the public.” He hedges this comment only slightly, saying that an ICO is “a high-risk investment” that should only be used “by those who really understand the market.” \nIt’s a good warning for now: ICOs have some growing pains to get through before they can be successfully normalized and trusted. Rest assured that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission is paying close attention. In May 2016, the SEC investigated a $150 million ICO by an organization called The DAO, ultimately finding that those tokens qualified as conventional securities, making them subject to the same regulations as stocks and bonds. But just because the SEC deemed The DAO’s tokens legit doesn’t automatically grant the same validity to all other ICOs. \nICOs are something of the Wild West of financial technology. Because the blockchain is open source, it can be reappropriated to innumerable different ends. In some cases, these reappropriations will meet the stringent legal definition of “security,” and others may not. The best-case scenario is that an ICO provides value to the tokenholder while yielding capital to the corresponding company. In worst-case scenarios , an ICO organizer simply vanishes with the money, leaving investors scammed and without recourse. \n“Many ICOs we have seen in recent months were based on little more than white papers, and resemble IPOs,” says Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of the blockchain-powered payments company Ripple. “We’ve previously highlighted these ICOs as unregulated, unsustainable, potentially deceptive, and detrimental to the long-term growth of the digital asset market, so we welcome the SEC stepping into the ring to clarify that certain types of ICOs are actually securities.” \nLaunching this month, a business called Blackmoon Crypto maintains a blockchain platform that seeks to bridge the gap between cryptocurrency technology and conventional investments. \nBlackmoon users don’t manage a portfolio, but a “tokenized fund” of assets, crypto or otherwise. Because the whole system is driven by the blockchain, it unlocks some cool capabilities. For example, investing is no longer limited by geography — a blockchain stays universally intact, no matter where its users are located. \n“There are institutional investors like Bessemer already investing in the blockchain, so we think this is the new reality,” says Blackmoon founder and CEO Oleg Seydak. “It’s not only a way to raise funding, but to gain a community of supporters for your cause at the same time.” \nFor now it is surely the East — countries like Russia, China, and Japan — leading the charge for blockchain assets to be the new normal. Investors in the West have “better access to structured financials like venture capital, private equity, and other traditional sources of capital,” says Seydak. Where Eastern markets are less developed, the blockchain is quickly asserting itself as a way to modernize one’s investments where the established financial infrastructure is lacking. \nWith the emergence of ICOs, familiar limiting factors like geography start to become irrelevant to investing — the nature of financial speculation is beginning to change due to technology. Regulation will eventually catch up, however, and it will only get “more difficult to use the ICO mechanism to conduct illegal or unscrupulous operations,” says Ivanov. \nDigital finance expert and author Dave Birch gave us the long view: “I think that ICOs are more of a picture of the money of the future than Bitcoin is. When the current craziness is past and tokens become a regulated but wholly new kind of digital asset — a cross between corporate paper and a loyalty scheme — they strike me as being something of an opportunity to remake markets in a new and better way.” \nIt worked wonders for an upstart zirconium plant in rural Russia. What could it do for you? This post is part of our contributor series. The views expressed are the author's own and not necessarily shared by TNW. ",

If you'd like to learn more... - \nAt the beginning of the week , the HBO hackers , collectively known as “Mr. Smith ,” threatened to leak the Season 7 finale of Game of Thrones , titled The Dragon and the Wolf , to the internet. \nOn Friday, online publication Mashable reported that the hackers released “what they’re calling the sixth wave of leaks.” \nMashable claims that this leak happened to contain what the hackers say is the end to Season 7 of Game of Thrones. The summary Mashable received is allegedly the season-ending episode, which is set to air on HBO on Sunday. Hacker was living the dream and neighbours had no clue \nREAD MORE: HBO hackers threaten to leak ‘Game of Thrones’ Season 7 finale \nThe website claims that “the confidential plot summaries and outlines appear to provide, in exact detail, just how this season will end.” \nThe report continues: “Mashable has read the confidential summary, but has chosen not to publish the explicit details in this post. We’ve also reached out to HBO who declined to comment on the new data dump.” \nHBO referred to its previous statement. “The hacker may continue to drop bits and pieces of stolen information in an attempt to generate media attention,” the statement reads in part. “That’s a game we’re not going to participate in.” \nREAD MORE: HBO hack: Network’s social accounts taken over after ‘Game of Thrones’ episode leaked \nThe hackers have demanded approximately $6.5 million worth of Bitcoin from HBO. \nAfter threatening to “Be ready for GOT S& E6 &E7 as soon as possible,” the hackers say they “have access to many HBO platforms already.” \nSo far, the hackers have released multiple episodes of HBO shows including Game of Thrones , Curb Your Enthusiasm , Ballers and Room 104 , along with scripts of already-aired and upcoming episodes. \nThey’ve also leaked executive emails and released the personal phone numbers , email addresses and home addresses of Game of Thrones Season 7 cast members, among them Emilia Clarke (Daenerys), Lena Headey (Cersei), Peter Dinklage (Tyrion) and Kit Harington (Jon Snow). \nREAD MORE: HBO hackers release never-before-seen ‘Curb Your Enthusiasm’ episodes \nTwo weeks ago, the hackers released an email allegedly sent to them by HBO offering $250,000 in exchange for a halt to the leaks. The legitimacy of the email hasn’t been confirmed by HBO, though an anonymous executive at the company said it was genuine. \nThe hackers claim that they’re not criminals, but “white hats” (used to reference people of good and moral standing, or, in computer speak, someone who hacks into a network to evaluate its security). \nIn the ransom note sent to HBO, they say, “Its [sic] a game for us.

We want to be your partner in a tiny part of HBO’s huge income.” \nREAD MORE: HBO hackers leak email from network offering them $250,000 \nSo far the HBO leaks have been limited, falling well short of the chaos inflicted on Sony in 2014. In that attack, hackers unearthed thousands of embarrassing emails and released personal information, including salaries and social security numbers, of nearly 50,000 current and former Sony employees. \nThe hackers claim to have 1.5 TB worth of data, including scripts, upcoming episodes of HBO shows and movies, and information damaging to HBO. \n—With files from Chris Jancelewicz ",

Asus has unveiled just the board for you -- the B250 Mining Expert. what's hot on zdnet Must read : Six features the iPhone needs to stay ahead of Android \nThere are quite a few cryptocurrency mining motherboards already out there -- such as the ASRock H110 Pro BTC+ which is equipped with 13 PCIe slots -- but Asus has raised the bar substantially with a motherboard that has 18 PCIe 3.0 x1 slots along with a physical 3.0 x16 slot. \nThe Asus B250 Mining Expert is built around the B250 chipset, and features an LGA1151 socket that supports Intel 6th and 7th generation processors (the processor doesn't really matter much when it comes to cryptocurrency mining -- the GPUs are the powerhouse. The board can support up to 32GB of DDR4 in dual-channel mode at 2400 MHz, and there are four SATA3 ports for storage purposes. PREV \nThere is also the usual selection of USB, HDMI, and Gigabit LAN ports, although they are not as prolific compared to a high-end motherboard (this is, after all, a mining motherboard). \nBut what makes this board special are the cryptocurrency mining tweaks. Specifically, the support for up to 19 graphics cards. At present the board can only support eight Nvidia and eight AMD cards to a total of 16, but AMD drivers will soon be updated to increase the support up to 11 cards, taking the total up to 19. \nThe board also features three 24-pin PSU connectors and three 4-pin Molex connectors to supply the board with the power it needs to keep everything running. \nThe idea behind the B250 Mining Expert is that it will allow cryptocurrency miners to save money by consolidating multiple mining PCs into a single system (or build a single machine instead of building three or so separate systems). \nAvailability and pricing haven't yet been announced, but expect the B250 Mining Expert to land in the coming months and cost around $150.

  "text": "August 25, 2017 / 6:54 AM / 20 hours ago Russian hackers feel the heat as Trump seeks warmer Moscow ties Jack Stubbs and Joseph Menn 6 Min Read FILE PHOTO: Alexander Vinnik, a 38 year old Russian man (L) suspected of running a money laundering operation, is escorted by a plain-clothes police officer to a court in Thessaloniki, Greece July 26, 2017. Alexandros Avramidis/File Photo MOSCOW/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - When Alexander Vinnik was arrested on money-laundering charges at a Greek hotel in late July, the status of his Jabber secure online messaging account was set to \"away\". \"He often takes some time to reply, so at first I didn't think anything of it,\" said one person who knew the Russian as an administrator of a digital currency exchange which U.S. prosecutors say was used to launder criminal funds. \"Then when I saw his picture on the news, I knew he would be 'away' for a long time,\" said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The U.S. Justice Department says Vinnik facilitated crimes including computer hacking, fraud and drug trafficking by laundering at least $4 billion through BTC-e -- an exchange used to trade bitcoin and other digital currencies -- since 2011. The 37-year-old faces up to 55 years in prison if extradited to the United States. He denies the allegations against him, according to Greek media reports, and BTC-e has said he never worked for the exchange. Reuters was unable to reach BTC-e or a lawyer representing Vinnik for comment. Vinnik is now one of seven Russians arrested or indicted on U.S. cyber crime charges this year. On average, just two Russian cyber criminals were extradited to the United States each year between 2010 and the start of this year, according to a Reuters review of U.S. Justice Department filings, Russian government statements and sources briefed on the matter. The increase to a record level shows that although President Donald Trump is trying to improve relations with Moscow, the United States has not shied away from pursuing Russians suspected of cyber crime. The prosecutions coincide with intensified scrutiny of Russian hackers since U.S. intelligence officials determined that Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election using cyber warfare methods to help Trump. The Kremlin has denied accusations it interfered in elections in the United States or elsewhere. Related Coverage Factbox: U.S. arrests of Russian cyber criminals hit record high But U.S. opposition lawmakers have questioned whether Trump is willing to respond forcefully to Moscow over its actions in cyberspace, and the White House has avoided publicly accusing Russia over recent politically-motivated hacking attacks.. Alarmed by Trump's proposal to create a joint U.S.-Russia cyber security unit, U.S. lawmakers have also drawn up a draft bill that would require him to notify lawmakers before he does so. Four U.S. federal law enforcement officials, who discussed the recent arrests with Reuters on condition of anonymity, said there had been no centralized effort to step up action against Russian cyber criminals under Trump. The increase in the number of arrests stemmed from breakthroughs made in investigations before last year's election, two of them said. The FBI referred all questions to the U.S. Justice Department. The Justice Department said it did not track arrests or indictments by nationality and declined further comment. FILE PHOTO: Alexander Vinnik, a 38 year old Russian man (C) suspected of running a money laundering operation, is escorted by plain-clothes police officers to a court in Thessaloniki, Greece July 26, 2017. Alexandros Avramidis/File Photo RUSSIAN HACKERS RATTLED Some U.S. officials, however, acknowledged that individual agents may now be more motivated to move against Russian cyber criminals following the election hacking scandal. Russian hackers are active at all levels of cyber crime, from small-time thefts of online banking details, to taking down the computer networks of multi-national companies and government departments. John Carlin, who until last October ran the national security division of the U.S. Justice Department as assistant attorney general, said resources had already been moving towards pursuing Russian nationals before the 2016 election. But he added: \"Their outrageous activity to undermine the integrity of our election, like they did in western Europe before and have done since, can only have added fuel to the fire.\" According to interviews with five people who knew the men arrested this year -- all of whom declined to be named for fear of prosecution -- the arrests have shaken the Russian cyber crime community. \"Now they are arresting even those who had a super indirect, not even direct connection to what they call influencing their election,\" said one who knew Vinnik by his online moniker WME. Used to operating across borders with relative impunity, Russian cyber criminals are now worried the prosecutions will lead to further arrests or harm their operations. They are cutting back on trips abroad that were once seen as a calculated risk because of the risk of arrest and extradition, but are now viewed as increasingly foolhardy. \"We have monitored criminals discussing the aftermath (of the arrests) ... and it is clear they are concerned about two things,\" said Ilya Sachkov, head of cyber security firm Group-IB, whose Threat Intelligence unit specializes in monitoring and tracking the Russian-speaking cyber crime community. \"First, what the arrested members potentially know about them, but second and more importantly, a disruption in their ability to make money.\" One of those arrested this year was Peter Levashov, charged by U.S. prosecutors with operating one of the world's largest botnets, or networks, of infected computers used by cyber criminals. He denies the charges. Levashov allegedly used the botnet to pump out spam emails for a multitude of criminal schemes, such as stock fraud, online credential phishing attempts and the distribution of malware, including ransomware. A person who knew Levashov by his online identity Severa said his arrest in particular had rattled underground cyber criminal circles because he was so well known. \"People read the news of course and see guys they know getting busted,\" the person said. \"Once is bad, this many times is scary.\" Additional reporting by Dustin Volz in SAN FRANCISCO, Eric Auchard in FRANKFURT, and Karolina Tagaris in ATHENS; Editing by Timothy Heritage",

  "text": "TROJAN HORSE This Is How Cops Trick Dark-Web Criminals Into Unmasking Themselves Dutch cops may have used a booby-trapped file to lure suspected criminals into exposing their IP addresses. Joseph Cox 08.25.17 12:00 AM ET \nLast month the FBI took down AlphaBay , the largest dark-web marketplace in existence. As part of the same operation, European authorities announced they had infiltrated Hansa, another online market , and claimed they had somehow obtained information that could help identify users who would have usually been protected by veils of digital anonymity. \nDutch police may have used a novel technique to unmask suspects—a booby-trapped file that drug dealers downloaded to their computers—including criminals likely in the U.S., according to digital evidence obtained by The Daily Beast. Although the tools cybercriminals use , such as the Tor network, are generally robust, law enforcement or hackers can still find workarounds. \n“DON’T open the xlsx locktime file,” a post on Reddit from late July reads , referring to an Excel file hosted on Hansa. Drug dealers selling their wares on Hansa could download the file for a summary of their recent transactions. Usually, the file was a plain old text document, but someone recently switched it to the Excel format, according to another Reddit post . It’s not clear when exactly the switch occurred, but Politie, the Dutch police, secretly took over Hansa on June 20, according to a previous Politie press release . On its own dark-web site, Politie wrote it had changed the code of Hansa, allowing the agency to capture passwords, bitcoins, and other information. \nWhoever switched the text file to an Excel document could have added additional bits of code within the download. Some files can surreptitiously connect to the internet, while others may run programs that lock down a target computer. \nThe Daily Beast obtained a copy of the file hosted on Hansa, and confirmed that when opened with Microsoft Office on Windows the file tries to connect to a remote server. Crucially, it does this outside of Tor—the anonymity network cybercriminals use to hide their tracks and protect dark-web drug markets—meaning the file exposes the user’s real IP address. Armed with this IP address, cops can then approach the relevant internet service provider and demand identifying details on who is behind it. The file The Daily Beast obtained appears to relate to a U.S.-based dealer on Hansa, judging by their online handle. \nBuried within the Excel file is a set of commands that tell the file which server to contact. The structure is similar to that of a so-called Canarytoken, a tool digital defenders typically use to notify them when a hacker steals or downloads their files. Cybersecurity firm Thinkst maintains the Canarytoken software. \nHaroon Meer, founder of Thinkst, told The Daily Beast the Hansa file included elements that were similar in structure to a Canarytoken. \nIt’s not clear how many Hansa drug dealers downloaded the file. Although Politie’s FAQ on the Hansa takedown doesn’t mention this Excel file, it does say, “Information about individuals from other countries has been shared with the appropriate agencies through Europol. It’s up to these agencies what they will do with the information.” \nNot much information is available about the server that the Hansa file reaches out to. It is based in France and belongs to popular web-hosting company OVH, according to online records. When connecting to the server at the time of writing, it just displays a generic error message. But according to one of the Reddit posts , in July the IP address pointed to a page identical to Hansa. \n“That is further suggesting that it was part of a deanonymization scheme,” Nicholas Weaver, a senior researcher at the International Computer Science Institute at UC Berkeley, told The Daily Beast in an email. \nComments from European officials also indicate this suspicious Excel file may be connected to a law-enforcement operation. In a previous interview with this reporter , Rob Wainwright, the head of Europol, implied that some sort of tool was used to identify Hansa users. And Petra Haandrikman, the leader of the Dutch unit that infiltrated Hansa, told security journalist Brian Krebs , “We did use some technical tricks to find out who people are.” \nThis all sounds similar to the way law-enforcement agencies have unmasked other suspects who use Tor. Australian cops sent child-pornography suspects a video that connected to a server the police controlled. And the FBI has repeatedly done something similar with poisoned files. Earlier this month prosecutors announced charges against an alleged extortionist; the FBI added code to a video that surreptitiously phoned home to a government-run computer.

  "title": "Why HBO was right to stand its ground against Game of Thrones hackers",
  "text": "A fter hackers stole a huge data trove from HBO they posted a menacing ransom letter last month in the form of a scrolling video which referenced Game of Thrones .\n\n“Our demand is clear and non-negotiable,” it said, accompanied by the series’ score. “By ignoring this new era, the first victims will be your reputation and your empire ... declare your surrender!”\nIf the network did not pay a multi-million dollar ransom in bitcoins it would suffer “catastrophic” damage through leaks of emails, financial reports and upcoming, unseen episodes of hit shows, it said, signing off with an ominous addendum to the Game of Thrones injunction: “Winter is coming – HBO is falling.”\nThe message ended with an image of the Night King, who leads a frozen zombie horde that threatens all living things in the fantasy series. \nGame of Thrones secrets revealed as HBO Twitter accounts hacked Read more \nA month later, it’s still summer for HBO. The Time Warner-owned company apparently paid no ransom, weathered the leaks and despite the possibility of a last minute leak seems poised to screen the Game of Thrones’ seventh season finale as planned this Sunday.\nThe hackers – at least this time – lost, Andy Kleinick, said the head of the Los Angeles police department’s cyber crimes section, and a supervisor for the secret service’s LA electronic crimes task force. They hyped their threat and misjudged their leverage, he said. “I think it was stupid. They thought because it was Game of Thrones it’d be a big deal.” \nIndependent cybersecurity experts agreed that HBO seems to have emerged without serious damage despite the data dumps and banner headlines. They cautioned, however, that only HBO and the hackers know the full story. The company declined interview requests for this article.\nThe experts, who have advised other companies targeted by hackers, described such crises in terms of attacks, breaches, plundering, firewalls, war rooms, psychology and alliances – things familiar to characters in the Seven Kingdoms.\n“It’s a continuous evolution between attacker and defender. If you build a 10ft wall sales of 11ft ladders will go up,” said Richard Ford, chief scientist at Forcepoint. Even if HBO won this battle companies should not be complacent, he said. “It may not be you in the crosshairs now but you will be. No company can consider itself immune to the digital threat environment. That motto, winter is coming, has never been more relevant.”\nEarlier this year hackers threatened to leak the latest installments of Disney’s Pirates of the Caribbean franchise and Netflix’s Orange is the New Black series. Neither company is known to have paid ransoms.\nNo company can consider itself immune to the digital threat environment\nRichard Ford, Forcepoint \nHBO’s turn came at the end of June when an individual or group calling itself Mr Smith released four unreleased episodes of various shows and the script of an unreleased Game of Thrones episode. The hacker claimed to have stolen 1.5 terabytes of data, including shows, emails, actors’ personal details and shooting schedules for Westworld’s second season. A follow-up ransom note reportedly demanded $6m to avert further leaks.\nAdditional, unrelated blows hit the company. In India thieves smuggled a Game of Thrones episode from Prime Focus Technologies, which works with Star India, which carries HBO. HBO’s Nordic and Spanish outlets blundered by prematurely airing another episode. Someone then hacked HBO’s social media accounts . \nHBO’s crisis response team would have felt assailed on several fronts, said Ford. “Being inside that sort of war room is a pretty intense experience. You’re jugging multiple things, the CEO is breathing down your neck. Anything that’s moral and legal is fair game. You play whatever cards you can.” \nThe Mr Smith hack was the most serious, potentially imperiling HBO’s relationship with investors, employees and viewers. \n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Crisis management experts say that behind the scenes, HBO’s response team would have endured ‘a pretty intense experience’. Photograph: Justin Lane/EPA \nHBO appeared to cave in an email dated 27 July which offered the hackers $250,000, only for the hackers to leak the email to the media, along with additional material. “HBO hackers just hit us with another huge data dump,” said Mashable . “Oh boy, they’re quite something.”\nBut HBO held its nerve, according to anonymous sources who told several outlets the $250,000 was a ruse to buy time. \nSo far nothing embarrassing has emerged from the leaks, sparing HBO the drip drip of bitchy emails and pay inequality revelations which made Sony squirm during a 2014 attack. “There’s nothing salacious here,” said Richard Levick, head of the crisis-management firm Levick. “The fact that HBO hasn’t had to deal with that was incredibly helpful.”\nTwo other factors dulled the hackers’ blade. When hit shows leak online most fans ignore the opportunity for illicit, early viewing and and wait for the formal release, which is easier to stream and has no quality glitches. \nGame of Thrones has lost its evil streak – and it's a crying shame Read more \nPiracy also undermines ransom demands because once a show or film is formally released it is invariably bootlegged around the world, voiding hackers’ control over distribution.\nLevick said HBO had handled the crisis well. Success, he said, hinged on advance preparation, multi-disciplinary crisis response teams and industry-wide alliances between companies, even competitors, to combat hackers.\n\nFord, of Forcepoint, said the first step, when hit, was to not panic. “The ones that tend to make horrible mistakes don’t plan in advance.” Crisis teams needed investigators akin to hostage negotiators, he said. “You need those specialists who are skilled at reading people. We give away quite a lot in how we type and how we write.”\nThe HBO hackers may have no ransom, and the Game of Thrones finale may unfold without glitch, but that did not necessarily signify defeat, said Jeff Pollard, a security analyst at Forrester Research. “These attackers learned a lot. They gained more information about how to make an attack successful and will likely try again.”",

  "title": "easyMINE ICO Information and Interview - Bitcoin Chaser",
  "text": "\nBitcoinChaser: What kind of problem, market deficiency or opportunity inspired you to launch your project? easyMINE: Blockchain technology is becoming a force to be reckoned with. And one of the most important things connected with blockchain is mining. However, it’s not easy to become a miner. It requires not only money but also a lot of knowledge and time. What to buy? How to configure it? What software to install? All these questions—and there are many, many more—make it hard to start mining. And, of course, once you start, even more questions appear. We know this from our own experience. We are IT guys and even for us the process has been a constant challenge. The hardest part is managing the hardware on a daily basis—the constant work of actually keeping everything working. And there are no good solution on the market right now that would help with this. *** BC: How will your project address this problem, market deficiency or opportunity in a unique way? easyMINE: We will solve several problems: First, it will help you build proper mining equipment. This is the simplest part: our website will provide hardware descriptions, ratings and recommendations, and information on where to buy what you need. Second, it will help you run your machines. We will provide a dedicated operating system (easyMINE OS), which will include all the required software for a number of different blockchains (ETH, ETC, Zcash, Sia, and many more). You will only need to write the OS image to a flash drive, insert it in your rig, and boot it up. That’s all. Third, easyMINE will provide an administration dashboard, where you will be able to see all your hardware (with proper descriptions). It will let you choose what and where to mine, overclock the GPUs, and even flash the VBIOS remotely—with only a few clicks. Fourth, you will be able to modify all the settings manually or let our automation system do it for you. In the latter case, easyMINE will test each graphics card in your rig and determine the best settings. Fifth, easyMINE will constantly monitor all your hardware and automatically react to emergency situations. It will dynamically adjust the settings to keep the hardware running. Last, you will be immediately notified about any problems requiring your action, such as GPU malfunctions. To put it short: plug & mine. That’s the kind of user experience we want to provide. Of course, there will still be decisions to be made, but most of the “dirty work” will be handled by easyMINE automatically. *** BC: How do you think competition will develop in this segment of the market following your ICO? easyMINE: There are a handful of other mine management systems, but they solve the problem partially. There’s BIOS flashing software, there’s overclocking software, there’s monitoring software, and so on. But there is no single, unified, complete solution. easyMINE will manage every aspect of your mine and control all the operating parameters in such a way as to ensure maximum efficiency and profitability. And one more very important thing: we want to provide a platform of truly professional quality. Most of our team works in a software house and they’ve got a lot of experience in creating top-notch products. We’ve got experts in Java, JavaScript, Linux, UX, interface design, even machine learning and AI (which, in fact, will be extensively used by easyMINE). Our goal is to create a system accessible to everyone. It has to be intuitive and straightforward, but also provide all the functionalities required by expert users. Sure, there will be competition. However, as I’ve mentioned, we want to do this in a professional way. This is why we decided to do an ICO. *** BC: What are you planning to do with the proceeds of your ICO, and why? easyMINE: The plan is very simple: – 50-80% will go towards further development of easyMINE, – 10-40% will be allocated for marketing, PR, blockchain popularization efforts, etc., – a maximum of 10% will be used for other business expenses. There are no extra rewards for us in this—no raises or bonuses. We just want to create a great platform and popularize it! *** BC: For all those who have read your white paper (pdf) and are still on the fence about investing in your ICO, what can you tell them that could lead them to invest in your project? easyMINE: Our project is not a dream or fantasy. It is very real and has solid business foundations. easyMINE will earn money—we are sure of it! There is huge demand for a solution like this. Lots of people are already asking us how soon they can start using our system. We’ve been developing easyMINE for half a year now and we’re seeing tremendous progress. We think we might be ready for public beta testing as early as this September. Also, there is a great team behind this project—people with extensive knowledge and experience. And we have some pretty revolutionary ideas about how easyMINE can be used in the future. This is something we’re still working on, so let’s just leave it at that for now. Be prepared for a surprise, though. ",

  "title": "Leader of Sweden’s main opposition party steps down - Forex Repository",
  "text": "BitCoin Leader of Sweden’s main opposition party steps down \nSweden’s main opposition chief paid the worth for cosying as much as anti-immigration populists as she resigned on Friday only a 12 months earlier than parliamentary elections. \nAnna Kinberg Batra will step down after two and-a-half years as chief of the Moderate party after an inside rise up following a dramatic collapse in public help for the centre-right group. \nThat adopted her dangerous transfer to supply an olive department to the Sweden Democrats, a party that had till then been fully ostracised by all mainstream events as a result of of its roots within the neo-Nazi motion. \nHer resignation plunges the centre-right into disaster a 12 months earlier than elections, even because the centre-left authorities is portrayed because the weakest in generations. Earlier this month, Prime Minister Stefan Löfven got here below stress to resign himself following a dangerous IT scandal that some authorities members had recognized about for years. \nMs Kinberg Batra, the primary lady to steer her party, hinted on the depth of the issues afflicting the Moderates, who ran Sweden from 2006 till 2014 below the premiership of Fredrik Reinfeldt. \n“There are too many party members who are currently engaging in what can only be called self-harm,” she informed a hastily-called press convention. About half of the regional teams within the party had referred to as for her resignation. \nSupport for the party has fallen from about 25 per cent a 12 months in the past to about 15 per cent presently. Most of that plunge got here after Ms Kinberg Batra began talks with the Sweden Democrats in February. \n“I regret nothing about starting talks with the Sweden Democrats . . . [But] I am disappointed with our situation and I take responsibility for it,” Ms Kinberg Batra stated. \nThe function of the Sweden Democrats — who’re presently polling about 20 per cent — is complicating conventional Swedish politics as neither the centre-left nor centre-right has a majority with out not less than their implicit help. Mr Löfven has hinted he can be open to working with the 2 smaller events on the centre-right aspect however his overtures have been rebuffed. \nThe Swedish coverage of isolating the main anti-immigration party stands in distinction with neighbouring Norway and Finland the place such teams are presently in authorities, and in Denmark the place they get pleasure from appreciable affect in parliament. \nThe Moderates have struggled to say themselves ever because the widespread Mr Reinfeldt and Anders Borg, former finance minister, resigned after their election defeat in 2014. Mr Borg was seen by some as a possible future chief however has been pressured to resign from a number of company posts over an alleged sexual harassment scandal. Some Moderates have advised Carl Bildt, the previous prime minister and overseas minister within the earlier authorities, may return although he’s 68. \nMs Kinberg Batra had damaged a taboo in Sweden, a militarily non-aligned nation, by agreeing with the opposite three centre-right events that they might search Nato membership in the event that they gained subsequent 12 months’s elections.

  "title": "Did the Recent Bitcoin Hard Fork Just Create Money Out of Thin Air? | Lets Talk Payments",
  "text": "August 8, 2017  By : Aman Trivedi The Bitcoin Blockchain underwent a hard fork on August 1, 2017, at 12.37 PM UTC with the block number 478558 being the last common block between the two chains. A hard fork results in splitting of the path of a blockchain by invalidating transactions confirmed by nodes that have not been upgraded to the new version of the protocol software, unlike a soft fork, which is a change to the software protocol where only previously valid blocks/transactions are made invalid. In Bitcoin’s case, this event was a culmination of conflicting approaches towards Bitcoin scaling among fractions of the community, the details on which have been widely written about and shall not be the focus of this piece. How did the fork impact Bitcoin holders? \nPost fork, the nodes and by extension wallets exist on both the blockchains. Users holding private keys to their wallets can access their Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin (BTC), while in all other cases, it depends on the private key holding entity’s discretion on whether or not to provide BCH wallets on their platform. Among prominent cryptocurrency exchanges, Kraken , Bitfinex , Bittrex , ViaBTC , Huobi , OkCoin , Bitthumb , Korbit and CoinOne supported Bitcoin Cash while Poloniex and Coinbase have announced support, but have not yet implemented trading. \nSource: Crypto Compare \nFrom the above chart, a quick analysis can be done for a user holding private keys to his/her Bitcoin wallet. On August 1, the post fork Bitcoin traded around $2700-2800 range while the newly ‘air-dropped’ Bitcoin cash was tradable on exchanges for at least $217 which went to as high as $727 in the following days. \nThe 10-25% reward for just holding an asset beats any conventional paradigm of investment valuation; it would not be entirely inaccurate to say here that speculation had a substantial role to play in the “instant value” created here. The Aftermath: Cryptocurrency market cap sees a yet another all-time high \nIt is notable to mention here that unlike the negative impact brought about by hard forks in the past, the Bitcoin Hard Fork seems to have scared away the bears dominating the crypto markets for the past month, thereby causing the market to shrink to $65B on July 17 before almost doubling to the current value of $120 billion in a mere 20 days. \nSource: CMC \nAnother interesting observation here is the variation in the Bitcoin dominance index, which had seen a steep decline to ~40%, largely attributable to the ICO and subsequent altcoin explosion. The Bitcoin Hard Fork, however, momentarily, pulled the index out from its all-time low, another instance indicating towards the high stakes speculation rampant in the cryptocurrency markets \nSource: CMC \nWhich way is the Bitcoin Cash price headed to? \nThe biggest question that comes to our mind now pertains to the price of Bitcoin cash in future. Like with any conventional asset, Bitcoin Cash can be valued in two ways – one by estimating the fundamental factors affecting the demand/supply of the asset and the other by observing trends in a similar asset class. \nIn the cryptocurrency world, the former method would require us to gauge the miner interest in Bitcoin Cash which in turn depends on mining rewards and profitability. At the time of writing, the Hashrate or mining resources devoted to Bitcoin mining is 6542 PH/s almost 10 times of the 650 PH/s for Bitcoin Cash. Though, interestingly enough, Bitcoin cash community recently reduced the mining difficulty by 20% in an attempt to make the mining lucrative, however, the outcome of which is yet to be decided by the market. \nSource: Cryptocoin Charts \nThe second method involves a trend comparison with a similar asset, i.e., a forked chain of an existing blockchain. Ethereum Classic forked from Ethereum on July 20, 2017, and the price of ETC since then has ranged between 5-18% of Ethereum. \nThis data point provides a fairly acceptable reference to gauge Bitcoin cash price movement which has been confined in the 6-15% of Bitcoin’s price since launch, however, the reasoning behind both the forks are largely different and any correlation might be purely incidental. \nSource: Cryptocoin Charts Where did all the new money come from? \nSince the Bitcoin Hard Fork, the Cryptocurrency market has just recently been on another bull run, though maybe not as prolific as the previous one. This is also evident by Bitcoin search trends on Google which saw another spike off late. \nSource: Google Trends \nThe fresh fiat money can be attributed to a mix of retail interest and post-fork gradual deployment of institutional money by way of crypto-hedge funds and other investment vehicles. We have profiled a few of these new age crypto-only funds in our latest research report Evolution of the ICO . Having said all of the above and given our current constraints in differentiating the non-speculative from speculative value, it is too soon to gauge the long-term impact of the Bitcoin Hard Fork on cryptocurrency markets.

  "title": "Risk or Reward: What It Takes for an Exchange to Cash In on a New Currency? – CrytpoCoin Analyst",
  "text": "by Marie Gannon on August 27, 2017 Risk or Reward: What It Takes for an Exchange to Cash In on a New Currency? \nIt’s not always easy to be the new kid on the block(chain). \nSince it appeared online about a month ago, new cryptocurrency bitcoin cash has been under scrutiny from users, miners and investors, all intrigued by how this first large-scale hard fork in the original bitcoin network will affect them. Dont Risk Your Bitcoin Security! \nBut it’s maybe the consumer-facing businesses, namely the exchanges, that are most under pressure to make a decision, given the software development time, costs and regulatory burdens that go into supporting any new cryptocurrency with a unique blockchain. \nSome, however, came to a conclusion quick. Kraken and Bitfinex, two popular exchanges, embraced Bitcoin Cash immediately after the split. \nAccording to Jesse Powell, Kraken’s founder: \n“Kraken was one of the few exchanges to say early on that we’d support bitcoin cash for both funding and trading. Many exchanges were initially undecided about the extent of their support and some even said they wouldn’t support it at all. Now more exchanges have come around to say that they will support it, though some have said the support may not come for several months yet.” \nPowell’s comment takes a jab at Coinbase , the largest U.S.-based exchange , which initially came out strongly opposed to listing bitcoin cash. But as bitcoin cash continued to look successful – and after many of its users complained, some even filing a lawsuit – Coinbase did an about-face. \nNow, the exchange says it’s working to support the currency by January 1. According to an August 3 blog post, Coinbase decided to support bitcoin cash “based on factors such as the security of the network, customer demand, trading volumes and regulatory considerations.” Picking sides \nThe varying degrees of acceptance and support for this new cryptocurrency represent deeper divisions in the bitcoin community, specifically about the vision for the future of bitcoin (and cryptocurrency in general) and what will make the market most stable while allowing it to grow. \n“Everybody has their own opinions on the viability of differing models,” said Marco Santori, partner at Cooley LLP, and the leader of its fintech practice. \nThat debate, and questions about whether an exchange will “onboard a new cryptocurrency… and how many people will actually want it, have created some sharp divisions in the desirability of bitcoin cash,” he said. \nFor Kraken, who generally stayed out of the scaling debate as it was happening around the beginning of August, the answer was simple. \nPowell said, “We thought that the bitcoin cash fork was pretty likely to be successful and wanted our clients to benefit from it as much as possible, which means letting them trade the new tokens as soon as possible.” \nPlus, the exchange saw it as a way to increase their own revenue. \nPowell continued: \n“There can be a lot of price volatility around a fork and this presents a huge trading opportunity. We in fact had a rather large influx of new clients who signed up at Kraken and deposited their bitcoins with us prior to the fork so they could get their bitcoin cash and trade around this major event. Of course, we benefit too if there is a lot of trade volume so it can be a win-win for us and our clients.” \nWhile many of Kraken’s users immediately sold all their bitcoin cash, Powell said, “for every seller, there’s a buyer,” pointing to the bitcoin cash price not just holding up, but jumping recently to more than $700. \n“There are even ‘big-blockers’ out there who think bitcoin cash will eventually eclipse regular bitcoin, and probably some of these folks sold all their bitcoin for bitcoin cash,” Powell contends. Risk or reward? \nWhile the trading volume and revenue gleaned there seems like a positive for exchanges, there are other things, as Coinbase mentioned in its post, exchanges must be wary of. \nAccording to Calin Calianu, a Bitcoin ABC contributor, the exchanges “weren’t sure what was going on. They were nervous. Initially exchanges were requiring 10 to 20 confirmations on blockchain until deposits could be marked as cleared.” \nRecently, though, the early adopting exchanges like Kraken and Bitfinex reduced requirements to 10 or fewer confirmations. Yet, Powell said, that isn’t surprising since it’s always been quick to support new tokens with its “let-the-market-decide view.” \nBut Calianu, who supports bitcoin cash’s mission, told CoinDesk: \n“Others are being a little more cautious. It isn’t the safest currency to use. There’s one big miner that, if he wanted, could totally attack the network.” \nHe continued, stating the factoring of the risk versus the reward also characteristic of the size of the exchange . \n“Some are taking the larger risk of supporting bitcoin cash because they’re smaller and want to attract business [whereas] Coinbase is big and doesn’t see it as a risk they want[ed] to take. They want to see first if it’s worth their investment, if it’s going to go anywhere,” Calianu said. \nWhile there could be some ideology still at play, it could also be exchange ’s lack the technical expertise required to support new cryptocurrencies, which take a certain amount of software development. (That is, unless they’re tokens built on top of the ethereum platform). \nPowell explained Kraken had to add support for the new currency pairs that needed to be enabled, as well as support for deposits and withdrawals in the new token. \n“At Kraken, we are fortunate to have the technical ability to list new assets fairly quickly, though it is by no means trivial,” he said. “Probably the most time-consuming part of the process is adding the new funding gateways, because we are very careful about that and have many custom security features in our wallet systems.” \nCalianu seconds that, explaining that development costs can be quite expensive. He predicts to implement support for bitcoin cash could cost anywhere between $200,000 if the developers were really efficient and $1.5 million. \nExchanges “don’t want to spend the money and the several weeks development time, and then have the thing disappear the next day,” he said. Continuing questions \nBeyond the technical infrastructure alterations, Powell points out that in the case of a fork, his exchange has had to determine answers to a bevy of other major questions, including: which trading pairs it will offer; how soon after the fork it should enable trading in the new pairs; how margin trading would be handled across the fork; and how soon after the fork Kraken would enable deposits and withdrawals in the new token. \n“At this point,” Powell admits, “we don’t have a set policy about any of these things, and look at it on a case-by-case basis as the forks come up.” \nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Coinbase and Kraken. \nCash register via Shutterstock The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

  "title": "Venture Capital Malaysia - A Fundraising Guide for Startups | NEXEA",
  "text": "SHARES Venture Capital Malaysia \nVenture Capital Malaysia is a guide for Malaysian Startups looking for venture capital funding. We have also included a list of VCs at the end of the page. \nI will cover a few types of venture capital funding including Angel Investment , VC investment , PE investment and so on. Venture Capital Malaysia is a list that covers funding for idea stage, early stage, and growth stage startups. How does Venture Capital work in Malaysia? \nMany venture capital firms either have funds or a holdings company. The funds range from small funds of a few million to billions. The smaller VCs are backed by family offices while the larger funds are typically funded by pension funds, insurance companies, foundations, fund-of-funds, and sovereign wealth funds. They are known as the Limited partners in a fund. General Partners are those managing the fund – but their business title is usually Venture Partner . \nVC Firms in Malaysia require Startups that have the potential to grow at least 30X within 5-10 years to justify their investments. Below are the typical returns of Startups after 5-10 years. As you can see, those that return more than 30X will need to cover those that lose money (0-1X returns), plus give them enough returns to have at least 20-25% Internal Rate of Return (IRR). The data is from the US since the Malaysian market is just getting started. \nVenture capital malaysia minimum returns 30x – Correlation Ventures Venture Captial Malaysia Average IRR – EquityZen \n\nTo raise money from Venture Capital Malaysia, there are a few key things to watch out for, like your Team, Financials, Traction (Results), Product, Market, and so on. All of these are detailed in our Startup Pitch Deck guide – which also helps Startups to understand how VCs think when they go through your Pitch deck. Do look below as we detail how to secure venture capital investment in the Malaysia & Southeast Asia context. How to secure venture capital investment \nThere are a few things to consider when looking to secure venture capital funding in Malaysia. Some Venture Capital firms only do certain stages of funding in different stages of the Startup Lifecycle. Some others only do specific industries – so watch out for those that only do one specific industry, e.g. Fintech Startups only. Some others have a list of Startups that they can invest into – and this depends on the Malaysian VC’s mandate or agreement with their Limited Partners/Investors. Venture Capital Malaysia will explain below how to find the right VC alogn with other things to note. Find the Right Venture Capital in Malaysia by Stage Angel Round – usually an RM50k-RM500k round from angel investors or friends and family to go from idea to initial prototype. Many times, this is where Startups also go for Accelerator or Incubator programs . Seed Round – usually an RM500k – RM2M round from angel investors and a few early stage VC Firms in Malaysia to establish product-market fit with a series of initial customers Series A Round – usually an RM3M-RM10M round from VC Firms in Malaysia to grow the customer base and start to scale Series B Round – usually an RM15M+ round from later stage VC Firms in Malaysia to push towards becoming a market leader or expanding overseas After the Series B, companies will sometimes raise a Series C, D, E, etc., which can be a mix of both later-stage VC Firms in Malaysia as well as Private Equity firms (out of scope for this answer, but good to research the difference). Other things to note \nNot all VCs in Malaysia invest in everything. For example, many VCs do not invest in e-commerce websites, property projects, Bitcoin mining projects, etc. because these projects rarely have the potential for a 30X return in 5-10 years. The majority of VCs are looking for businesses that are somehow enhanced by IT – but not necessarily in the IT space. For example, Uber, Airbnb and Foodpanda are all IT-enhanced businesses in the industries of Transport, Accommodation and Logistics, which are in the past very traditional and slow growing businesses. The IT solutions implemented give these businesses huge scalability in their business models to grow fast enough to give a 30X return within 5-10 years. \nWhen is a good time to raise funds from Venture Capital? \nVenture capital Malaysia aims to explain when the right time to raise venture capital. There are a few things to consider before raising from Malaysian venture capital. This includes things like if it is time to trade ownership equity for capital investment. Should you work hard on becoming cash flow positive before raising money or at least have some revenue before raising money? It definitely affects your valuation negatively if you have not validated revenues or if you have not become breakeven. Most Startups that approach us are not break-even yet but those that get invested have at least some sort of revenues proven. We work with many Startups that are not yet break-even but have some sort of revenues. We support them with our network of successful business owners. We understand that taking off is hard, so we look to support Startups as much as we can. We usually separate Startups with and without revenue, where those with revenue are considered Startups with some sort of Validation and can be valued as much as 4X higher due to the fact that they may have enough revenue to justify the valuation. For example, some highly scalable startups with RM50k revenue a month can be valued at about 4X Revenues, which is: 50k*12*4=RM2.4M. \nIf they were to raise RM200k, that would be: 200k/2.4m = 8.3% equity dilution \nAt Nexea, we never want to take more than 10-20% of the company because we want the founders to continue to be motivated in the case that more funds are raised later on. \nDo you want to hold on to your company forever, or are you willing to let it go after some time and retire young? Does raising capital fit to the vision of the company and yourself, as the founder? \nSome founders tend to want to own their business forever, and that is fine. Some others feel that by sharing the pie, the pie actually grows larger. One of the advice that we usually give is to think of the amount of money you need to retire young or to live the rest of your life without financial worries. \nFor example, if you think you need Rm10M to retire young and live the rest of your life financially free, then you only need to own 20% of a RM50M company by the time you exit. Venture capital funding can help you reach that goal. To benefit the most from Venture Capital \nTo make the most of Venture Capital in Malaysia, you need to be ready for it. One of the things you will need to ensure is that you have your business plan tested and ready to be executed. One of the biggest mistakes we have seen is a Startup founder raising more than RM10m from Venture Capital and then spending it on the wrong things which brought little to no return to the value of the business . That is where testing/validation comes in to help you avoid mistakes like that. \nFor example, if you are an idea stage startup, you will want to ensure that there is a market , that your product is needed , and that people are willing to pay for it . Some Startups (even very large ones) have not done so, and are now paying the consequences in the form of down-rounds (valuation drops significantly), being avoided by VCs, or even having the CEO removed by their board members. It is always important to have the fundamentals of any business right so that you can build up your empire fast and steady. A great example of a Startup that validated well is Airbnb where there is a huge global demand, that people need cheaper accommodation, and that people are willing to pay for their fees. A huge factor for their success is that they are disrupting hotels that have traditionally been demanding high prices. What will Venture Capital Funds in Malaysia typically ask from Startups? \nVenture Capital Firms (VCs) in Malaysia look for a few key things in Startups. Of course, they give you money in exchange for your equity, or shares in your business. However, it also includes the Pitch Deck, asking amount, and usually Financials. If the deal starts to get serious, then they will start to do their due-diligence process, which can include calling up your suppliers and customers, checking your financials and accounting, and doing other forms of checks to ensure that they are not investing in something too risky. The Term Sheet \nVenture Capital Malaysia will try to explain the term sheet briefly for the main things to watch out for. The term sheet is an agreement where the VC in Malaysia and the Startup sign before the actual transaction. Startups need to negotiate and sign this upon both parties agreeing to the terms. \nInvestment Tip: Ensure that you write down the terms discussed and agreed upon so that they do not change by the time it is time to draft the actual term sheet. Do this in the order of importance to not-so-important, so that both parties can save time. \nGoing deeper, they may require things like Preferred Shares which have additional features and protection like a Liquidation Preference where they are guaranteed a certain return before the common shareholders get anything. Some Venture Capital in Malaysia also practices anti-dilution protection where in the event of a down-round (valuation goes down), they get protected from dilution of their equity. They can also have pro-rata rights and rights of refusal to invest further before an existing or new investor can, to maintain their equity percentage. Malaysian VCs can also ask for the right to be paid dividends , although dividends are usually not required by them. They would want Voting Rights and Board Seats to give them some control over the company in the case that there might be disagreements down the road. The Pitch Deck \nIt does not occur to many Startups just how important the pitch deck is to Malaysian VCs. It is the reference point to most important aspects of your business. That is why it is important to understand how a VC in Malaysia thinks when they are looking through your pitch deck. Here is an example pitch deck that does just that. \nFor example, the Problem & Solution slides are important for venture capital fund managers to understand what problem you are solving, and why it is important to society. It seems that society highly rewards people who solve painful problems (by paying for your service), so this is one of the main things VCs look at when evaluating your business. The problem being solved must be painful enough for people to throw money to solve it. A good example is a food delivery service like RunningMan, where people are willing to pay extra for food to be delivered. It is not the most painful problem all the time, but when you are stuck in a meeting or just had a really tiring day, it makes a lot of sense. Or, it must evoke so much desire that they just end up needing to pay for it. A great example is Spotify, where it is so much more convenient to subscribe and get all the music in the world compared to buying albums or downloading music. List of Malaysian Venture Capital \nBelow are the links to Venture Capital that invest into Malaysian companies by their investment stages. Venture Capital Malaysia List of VCs is to be updated regularly so that inactive venture capital in Malaysia are removed from this list.

IANS Washington, Publish Date: Aug 26 2017 1:32PM | Updated Date: Aug 26 2017 1:32PM HBO hackers leak ''Game of Thrones'' Season 7 climax Just a day before the last episode of \"Game of Thrones\" Season 7 set to hit the screens, the HBO hackers calling themselves as \"Mr Smith\" have leaked the climax of the ongoing season, thus ending the suspense that kept the millions of fans on toes. According to Mashable on Friday, the hacking group which stole approximately 1.5 terabytes of data from HBO have released, what they call, a sixth wave of leaks that contain confidential plot summaries and details of how the season will end. \"Mashable has read the confidential summary but has chosen not to publish the explicit details,\" the report said. In response, HBO has said the hackers may continue to drop bits and pieces of stolen information in an attempt to generate media attention. \"That's a game we're not going to participate in,\" HBO was quoted as saying. The hacking group demanded approximately $6.5 million worth of Bitcoin from HBO but that demand has not been met so far. However, the hacking group claimed to have sold the stolen data to three customers in deep web who paid them half of the amount they had requested in ransom from HBO. \"By the way, we officially inform you and other hundreds of reporters whom we are emailing that we sold 'HBO IS FALLING' entire collection (5 TB) to three customers in deep web and we earned half of the requested ransom,\" the hackers said. \"We put a condition for our respected customers and they approved. We will leak many many waves of HBO's internal stuff to punish them for playing us and set an example of greedy corporation.\" More in this Category ",

Shares tumbled 20% from their early-July peak through Aug. 15.\nClick Here To See A List Of The Top-Performing ETFs Of 2017 Q&A On ETFs With Schwab's Head Of Strategy & Product Development Top ETF Picks By Sage Advisory Services IShares Edge MSCI USA Momentum Factor ( MTUM ) was again the best performer among U.S. diversified stock funds, with a 23.2% return through Aug. 15, according to Morningstar Inc. Jumping to second place was PowerShares QQQ Trust ( QQQ ), which is up 22.2% YTD. Their one-month returns were a more modest at 1.4% and 1.3%, respectively.\nTechnology was the $52.3 billion QQQ's biggest sector weighting as of Aug. 15, at nearly 57% of assets. That's not surprising, given the ETF tracks the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index. Top five holdings, which accounted for 38% of assets, were Apple ( AAPL ), Microsoft ( MSFT ), Amazon.com ( AMZN ), Facebook ( FB ) and Alphabet ( GOOG ).\nSince clearing a flat-base entry last month, QQQ has made little headway.

  "title": "What is Cryptoeconomics? The Ultimate Beginners Guide - Blockgeeks",
  "text": "What is Cryptoeconomics? The Ultimate Beginners Guide An in-depth guide by BlockGeeks Join over 35, 889 members Angel investors, Startups & blockchain developers... Email \nWhat is cryptoeconomics? Ethereum developer Vlad Zamfir says that cryptoeconomics is: \n\n“A formal discipline that studies protocols that govern the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services in a decentralized digital economy. Cryptoeconomics is a practical science that focuses on the design and characterization of these protocols.” \n\n\nThe blockchain technology runs on the principles of cryptoeconomics. \nLet’s break it down. Cryptoeconomics comes from two words: Cryptography and Economics. People tend to forget the “economics” part of this equation and that is the part that gives the blockchain its unique capabilities. The blockchain wasn’t the first time that a decentralized peer-to-peer system was used, torrent sites have used it for ages to share files. However, in every sense of the word, it has been a failure. Why was peer-to-peer file sharing a failure? \n\nIn a torrent system , anyone can share their file with a decentralized network. The idea was that people would download them and keep seeding aka sharing the file with the network for others to download. The problem was that this worked on an honor system. If you were downloading a file, then you were expected to seed as well. The problem is that humans are not really the most honorable of creatures and without any economic incentives it made no sense for people to keep seeding a file which took up unnecessary space in their computers. \nSatoshi Nakamoto and the blockchain technology \n\nIn October 2008, an unknown man/woman/group calling themselves Satoshi Nakomoto released a paper which would lay the foundation for bitcoin . This would shake the online community to its very foundations, for the first time we had a working model for something based in cryptoeconomics. The way it differed from earlier p2p decentralized systems, was that people now actually had an economic incentive to “follow the rules”. But more than that, the true genius of the blockchain technology lied in how it circumvented the Byzantine General’s Problem to create a perfect consensus system (more on that later). \nCryptoeconomic properties of Bitcoin \nSo what are the properties that a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin has as a result of cryptoeconomics? \nLet’s go through them one by and one: It is based on the blockchain technology where each block contains the hash of the previous block and forms a continuous chain. Each block will include transactions. The blocks will have a particular state which is subject to change according to transactions. Eg. if A has 50 bitcoins and wants to send 20 bitcoins to B. Then The new state should show that A has 30 bitcoins left and B has 20 new bitcoins. The blockchain must be immutable. It should be possible to add new blocks but the old blocks can’t be tampered with. Only valid transactions should be allowed. The blockchain should be downloadable and anyone anywhere can easily access and check a particular transaction. Transactions could be added quickly to the blockchain if a sufficiently high transaction fee is paid. \nThere are two pillars of cryptoeconomics as the name itself suggests: Cryptography. \nNow let’s explore how these two lend the blockchain its unique characteristics. \nCryptography \nBlockchain technology uses cryptographical functions for its operations. Let’s looks at some of the main functions that run the blockchain: \nHashing \nIn simple terms, hashing means taking an input string of any length and giving out an output of a fixed length. Bitcoin uses SHA-256 to take in an input string of any length and giving an out hash of 256 bits. So what are the applications of hashing in cryptocurrency? \n\nA cryptographic hash function has the following properties: \nDeterministic: An input A will always have the same output h(A) no matter how many times you parse it through the same hash function. \nQuick Computation : A function should return a hash of an input as quickly as possible. \nPre-Image resistance: Given h(A) which is an output of a hash function, it should be infeasible to determine input A. \nCollision resistance : Given two inputs A and B and their hash outputs h(A) and h(B) it should be infeasible for h(A) = h(B). \nSmall changes : in the input should drastically affect the output of the hash function. \nPuzzle Friendly: For every hash output Y and an input x. It is infeasible to find a value k, which will result in h(k|x) = Y. \n\nThe cryptographic hash functions greatly help with security and mining in the blockchain. \nData Structures: \nThe two data structures that are important in understanding the blockchain are Linked Lists and Hash Pointers. Linked Lists: Linked lists are blocks of data which are connected to one after another. This is an example of a linked list: \nEach block in the list is pointing to the other via a pointer. Pointer: Pointers are variables which include the addresses of the other variables. So they are variables which are literally pointing towards the other variables. \nHash Pointers: Hash pointers are basically pointers which not only has the address of other variables but also the hash of the data in that variable. So how does that help in the context of a blockchain? \n\nThis is what a blockchain looks like: \nThe blockchain is basically a linked list where each new block contains a hash pointer which points to the previous block and the hash of all the data in it. Just this one property leads into one of Blockchain’s greatest qualities….its immutability. \nHow are blockchains immutable? \n\nSuppose in the diagram above someone tries to tamper with the data in block 1. Remember that one of the properties of cryptographic hash functions is that a slight change in the input data will greatly change the output hash. \nSo, even if someone tries to tamper with the data in block 1 even slightly, it will change its hash drastically which is stored in Block 2. This will, in turn, result in the change of the hash of Block 2 which will result in the change of hash in block 3 and that will keep ongoing on and on till the end of the blockchain. This will freeze up the chain, which is impossible, so just like that, the chain is rendered tamper-proof. \n\nEach block also has its own Merkle Root. Now, as you are already aware, every block has a lot of transactions. If the transactions were to be stored in a linear manner, it will be extremely cumbersome to go through all the transactions just to find a particular one. \nThis is why we use a Merkle tree. \nIn a Merkle Tree, all the individual transactions are distilled down into one root via hashing. And this makes traversal very easy. So, if someone were to access a particular data in a block, instead of going through them linearly they can simply traverse using the hashes in the Merkle tree to get to the data: Mining \nCrypto-puzzles are used in order to mine new blocks and for that hashing is critical as well. So the way it works is that there is a difficulty level that is set. After that, a random string called “nonce” is appended to the hash of the new block and hashed again. After that is it checked whether it is less than the difficulty level or not. If it is then the new block is added to the chain and a reward is given to the miner(s) responsible. If it isn’t less than the difficulty, the miners keep changing the nonce and wait for a value which would be less than the difficulty. \n\nAs you can see, hashing is a critical part of blockchain and cryptoeconomics. \nSignatures \nOne of the most important cryptographical tools that are used in cryptocurrency is the concept of signatures. What is a signature in real life and what are its properties? Imagine a paper that you have signed with your signature, what should a good signature do? \nIt should provide verification. The signature should be able to verify that it is you who actually signed the paper. It should be non-forgeable. No one else should be able to forge and copy your signature. Non-repudiation. If you have signed something with your signature, then you should not be able to take it back or claim that someone else has done it instead of you. \n\nIn the real world, however, no matter how intricate the signature, there are always chances of forgery, and you cannot really verify signatures using simple visual aids, it is very inefficient and non-reliable. \n\nCryptography gives us a solution using the concept of public and private key. Let’s see how the two keys work and how it fuels the cryptocurrency system. Suppose there are two people, Alan and Tyrone. Alan wants to send some very important data and Tyrone needs to authenticate that the data actually came from Alan. The way they are going to do it is by using Alan’s public and private key. \n\nOne important thing to note: It is infeasible to determine one’s public key from one’s private key. The public key is public as the name states, and anyone can have that key. The private key, however, is something that only you should have and you must NOT share it with anyone. \n\nSo, let’s go back to Alan and Tyrone if they are to exchange messages using the keys how will it look? \n\nSuppose Alan wants to send a message “m”. Alan has a private key Ka- and a public key Ka+. So when he sends the message the Tyrone he will encrypt his message with his private key so the message becomes Ka-(m). When Tyrone receives the message he can retrieve the message by using Alan’s public key, Ka+(Ka-(m)) and retrieves the original message “m”. \n\nTo summarize: Alan has a message “m” which he encrypts with his private key Ka- to get encrypted message Ka-(m). Tyrone then uses Alan’s public key Ka+ to decrypt the encrypted message Ka+(Ka-(m)) to get the original message “m”. \n\nCheck out this diagram for a visual representation: \n\n\nVerification : If the encrypted message gets decrypted by using Alan’s public key then it verifies 100% beyond proof that Alan was the one who sent the message. \n\nNon-Forgeable: If someone, say, Bob, intercepts the message and sends his own message with his private key, Alan’s public key won’t decrypt it. Alan’s public key can only decrypt messages encrypted with his private key. \n\nNon-Repudiable : Similarly, if Alan says something like, “I didn’t send the message, Bob did” and Tyrone is able to decrypt the message using Alan’s public key, then this shows that Alan is lying. This way he can’t take back the message that he sent and put the blame on anyone else. \n\nApplications in cryptocurrency: Now suppose Alan is sending some transaction “m” to Tyrone. He will first hash his transactions using a hash function. And then encrypt it using his private key. Tyrone knows that he is getting a transaction “m”, so he can then decrypt the message using Alan’s public key and compare the hashes of the of the resulting decryption with the hash of the transaction “m” that he has already. As hash functions are deterministic and will always give the same output to the same input, Tyrone can easily determine that Alan did indeed send that exact same transaction and there was no malpractice involved. \nAlan has a transaction “m” and Tyrone knows that he is getting “m” as well. Alan hashes m to get h(m). Alan encrypts the hash with his private key to get Ka-(h(m)). Alan sends the encrypted data to Tyrone, Tyrone uses Alan’s public key to decrypt Ka+(Ka-(h(m))) to get the original hash h(m). Tyrone can then hash the “m” that he originally had to get h(m). If h(m) = h(m), as it should be because hash functions are deterministic, then this means that the transaction was free of malpractice. \nProof Of Work \nWhen miners “mine” to form new blocks to add to the blockchain, the consensus system by which the blocks get approved and added is called “proof-of-work”. Miners use heavy duty computational power to solve cryptographical puzzles to satisfy a difficulty level. This is one of the most path-breaking mechanisms in blockchain technology. Earlier decentralized peer-to-peer digital currency systems used to fail because of something called the “Byzantine General’s Problem”. The proof-of-work consensus system finally provided a solution to this problem. \n\nWhat is the Byzantine General’s Problem? \nImage Courtesy: Medium \n\nOk so imagine that there is a group of Byzantine generals and they want to attack a city. They are facing two very distinct problems: \nThe generals and their armies are very far apart so centralized authority is impossible, which makes coordinated attack very tough. The city has a huge army and the only way that they can win is if they all attack at once. \n\nIn order to make successful coordination, the armies on the left of the castle send a messenger to the armies on the right of the castle with a message that says “ATTACK WEDNESDAY.” However, suppose the armies on the right are not prepared for the attack and say, “NO. ATTACK FRIDAY” and send back the messenger through the city back to the armies on the left. This is where we face a problem. A number of things can happen to the poor messenger. He could get captured, compromised, killed and replace with another messenger by the city. This would lead to the armies getting tampered information which may result in an uncoordinated attack and defeat. \n\nThis has clear references to blockchain as well. The chain is a huge network; how can you possibly trust them? If you were sending someone 4 Ether from your wallet, how would you know for sure that someone in the network isn’t going to tamper with it and change 4 to 40 Ether? \n\nSatoshi Nakamoto was able to bypass the Byzantine General’s problem by inventing the proof of work protocol. This is how it works. Suppose the army on the left want to send a message called “ATTACK MONDAY” to the army on the right, they are going to follow certain steps. \nFirstly, they will append a “nonce” to the original text. The nonce can be any random hexadecimal value. \nAfter that, they hash the text appended with a nonce and see the result. Suppose, hypothetically speaking, the armies have decided to only share messages which, on hashing, gives a result which starts with 5 zeroes. \nIf the hash conditions are satisfied, they will send the messenger with the hash of the message. If not, then they will keep on changing the value of the nonce randomly until they get the desired result. This action is extremely tedious and time-consuming and takes a lot of computation power. \nIf the messenger does get caught by the city and the message is tampered with, according to hash function properties, the hash itself will get drastically changed. If the generals on the right side, see that the hashed message is not starting with the required amount of 0s then they can simply call off the attack. \n\nHowever, there is a possible loophole. \n\nNo hash function is 100% collision free. So what if the city gets the message, tampers with it and then accordingly change the nonce until they get the desired result which has the required number of 0s? This will be extremely time-consuming but it is still possible. To counter this, the generals are going to use strength in numbers. \n\nSuppose, instead of just one general on the left sending messages to one general on the right, there are 3 generals on the left who have to send a message to the ones on the right. In order to do that, they can make their own message and then hash the cumulative message and then append a nonce to the resulting hash and hash it again. This time, they want a message which starts with six 0s. \n\nObviously, this is going to be extremely time-consuming, but this time, if the messenger does get caught by the city, the amount of time that they will take to tamper the cumulative message and then find the corresponding nonce for the hash will be infinitely more. It may even take years. So, eg. if instead of one messenger, the generals send multiple messengers, by the time the city is even halfway through the computation process they will get attacked and destroyed. \n\nThe generals on the right have it pretty easy. All they have to do is to append the message with the correct nonce that will be given to them, hash them, and see whether the hash matches or not. Hashing a string is very easy to do. That, in essence, is the process behind proof-of-work. \nThe process of finding the nonce for the appropriate hash target should be extremely difficult and time-consuming. However, the process of checking the result to see if no malpractice has been committed should be very simple. \nZero Knowledge Proofs. \n\nWhat is a zero knowledge proof (zkp)? ZKP basically means that a person A can prove to person B that they have knowledge of a certain piece of information without telling them what that knowledge specifically is. In this example, the person A is the prover and the person B is a verifier. In cryptography, this becomes especially useful because this helps in proving an extra layer of privacy for the prover. \n\nFor a ZKP to work it needs to satisfy certain parameters: \nCompleteness: If the statement is true then an honest verifier can be convinced of it by an honest prover. Soundness: If the prover is is dishonest, they can’t convince the verifier of the soundness of the statement by lying. Zero-Knowledge: If the statement is true, the verifier will have no idea what the statement actually is. \n\nAn example of a ZKP is the Alibaba cave, let’s see how it works. In this example, the prover (P) is saying to the verifier(V) that they know the password of the secret door at the back of the cave and they want to prove it to the verifier without actually telling them the password. So this is what it looks like: \nImage courtesy: Scott Twombly (YouTube channel) \n\nThe Prover goes down any of the paths A and B, suppose they initially decide to go through path A and reach the secret door at the back. When they do so, the verifier V comes in at the entrance, with no knowledge of which path the prover actually took and declares that they want to see the prover appear from path B. \n\nIn the diagram, as you can see, the prover does indeed appear in path B. But what if this was dumb luck? What if the prover didn’t know the pass code, and took the path B, was stuck at the door and by sheer fortune, the verifier told him to appear from path B, the one they were originally on anyway? \n\nSo, to test the validity, the experiment is done multiple times. If the prover can appear at the correct path every single time, it proves to the verifier that the prover indeed knows the password even though the verifier doesn’t know what the password actually is. \nWhat is the application of ZKP in blockchain? \n\nMany blockchain based technologies are using Zk-Snarks, in fact, even Ethereum in its Metropolis phase is planning to bring in Zk-Snarks and add it to its arsenal. Zk-Snarks stands for “Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge” and it proves a computational fact about the data without revealing the data itself. \n\nThey can be used to generate a proof of statement to verify each and every transaction by just taking a simple snapshot of each transaction which is enough to prove to the receiving side that a transaction was done without revealing the transaction itself. \n\nThis achieves two things: The integrity and privacy of the transaction is maintained. By not revealing the inner workings of the entire transaction the system maintain abstraction which makes it infinitely easier to use. \n\nSo these are some of the important cryptographical functions which are being used by the blockchain. Now let us look at the second pillar, Economics. \nEconomics \nLike we mentioned in the beginning, the place where blockchain differs from other decentralized peer-to-peer system is that it gives its users financial and economic incentives to get some work done. Like with any solid economic system, there should be incentives and rewards for people to get work done, similarly, there should be a punishment system for miners who do not act ethically or do not do a good job. We will see how the blockchain incorporates all these basic economic fundamentals. \n",

  "title": "Women in Blockchain: An interview with Deepa Sathaye, AIRSWAP - Unblocked Events",
  "text": "Interviews 23rd August 2017 Women in Blockchain: An interview with Deepa Sathaye, AIRSWAP \nHi Deepa – Thanks for joining us on Chain Reaction this week to discuss the decentralised web, women in blockchain and your work as an engineer at AIRSWAP: \nWhy did you first get interested in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology? \nMy first exposure to cryptocurrencies was sometime in 2012 when a few of my coworkers were investing in Bitcoin, and I knew of a local coffee shop that let you buy coffee with Bitcoin. The idea of an alternative currency that was not tied to governments or existing financial institutions was a fascinating concept to me. Fast forward to 2015, I learned about “smart contracts” and began researching it along with blockchain technology. Smart contracts mean that systems can be built without having to trust a singular body. Now, everyday, I’m continuously more interested in what is going on in this field and the number of applications people are exploring to use the technology. \nIf you had to explain it to a total newcomer, what is the most exciting thing about Blockchain and distributed ledger technology? How is it going to change the world? \nBlockchain technology and decentralization have limitless possibilities. Almost every person on earth can be positively impacted by Blockchain and distributed ledger technology. Blockchain has the potential to reduce bureaucratic bloat and allow information to be tracked by interested parties securely. Smart contracts allow for new governance models that can now surpass physical boundaries where they couldn’t before. We’ve only scratched the surface of the opportunities on how this technology will affect us as individuals and the world. \nRecently, a manifesto from a (now former) Googler has been circling the internet, what is your opinion on how these narratives affect female participation in tech and overall diversity? \nHonestly, because of the open outrage and swift actions of Google, I don’t think that this particular narrative will negatively affect women’s participation in tech and diversity in general. I hope anyone exposed to this narrative also sees the general negative response. I’m grateful that we live in a society that this manifesto is not acceptable or even considered remotely true. That doesn’t stop me from being worried though. What gets me worried is when similar conversations and ideas are talked about in smaller circles. When these are the only ideas that get promoted, this leads to an extremely biased environment and people feeling limited due to their gender or race. \nI’m concerned that people have decided to be more comfortable about expressing such alarming viewpoints. Deeming a gender less suitable for a software engineering position due to biological differences is antiquated and outright wrong. I’m also worried about the people who agree with the narrative’s depiction of engineering. Engineers cooperate daily and building a product for humans requires empathy. The manifesto was chilling not just because of the ideas expressed but because of where it came from and who it came from. While Google distanced themselves immediately from this individual, it’s alarming that a senior engineer at a prestigious tech company, and someone who many of us would consider a highly intelligent person, is carrying out and sharing these outdated views. \nDo you see more evidence that women are being attracted to work in this space and, if so, why do you think that’s changing? \nI personally do not see strong evidence that there are more women working in this space. However, I have met women who are interested in the space and these women have begun evaluating opportunities using blockchain. Each has her own reasons which tends to differ but as more and more people speak about the technology and possibilities, the number will grow. I would encourage anyone interested in this technology to get involved because right now everyone is still learning and there is a lot of opportunity to grow and develop with the community. I have found the community to be welcoming. With that said, I do see women holding important roles in Blockchain which makes me happy and proud and I encourage others to at least educate themselves on Blockchain and watch the space. \nWhat are you building at AIRSWAP and how is it going to change the marketplace? \nWith AIRSWAP, we are building a platform that will be integral to growing the Ethereum ecosystem. As there are more and more Ethereum based tokens added, having a peer-to-peer trade platform will help the growth of the Ethereum. We are building a platform that allows interested parties to find each other, privately negotiate a trade, and then finally execute a trade on the Ethereum blockchain. AIRSWAP will serve the needs of the community and provide a great user experience. \nCan Blockchain technology live up to the hype or will progress get bogged down by scaling and security concerns or regulatory hurdles? \nAs blockchain technology becomes more integrated with society and as more token offerings occur, there will be more conversations regarding scalability, security, and regulation. At this point, some solutions have been proposed to address scalability, such as state channels and changing the consensus protocol. Blockchain is still a very new technology and so it is difficult to predict a direct path for integration of blockchain technology and all of the opportunities that may come with it. In Japan, South Korea, and UK, legislation has already been discussed on how to treat cryptocurrencies which, to me, shows a willingness to work with cryptocurrencies instead of trying to stifle the growth and innovation. \nWhy is a decentralised peer-to-peer trading platform useful compared to existing order books or platforms? \nOrder books that exist in traditional financial settings can efficiently facilitate trades at a fair price. However, just putting an order book onto a blockchain is not the correct solution to allow people to trade different tokens. Using a peer-to-peer trading platforms addresses certain disadvantages in the current model such as scaling and fairness. Our protocol allows for discovery of peers as well as enable fair pricing to allow for a decentralized trading platform. \nWhat’s next for you and the AIRSWAP team? \nAt the beginning of August we announced AIRSWAP and the AIRSWAP membership token, “AIR”, that gives you a seat to join the peer-to-peer token trading ecosystem. With this ecosystem, you’ll get the ability to find parties to trade with and get fair prices. AIRSWAP will implement the Swap protocol, a decentralized peer-to-peer protocol for exchanging ERC20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. AIR will be sold exclusively through the platform starting on October 10. A percentage of AIR tokens have been reserved for Swap Beta program participants. \nYou can learn more about AIRSWAP: airswap.io or follow them at @AirSwapio . \nTo stay in touch with Deepa, follow her on Twitter @poiresel . \nEndorsements \n\"I had the pleasure of meeting Helen Disney last year when she organised what I would have said was the premier event in Blockchain.\" Genevieve Leveille - Founder, 0tentic8 \n\"Very interesting and a proper glimpse into the not-too-distant future.

  "title": "Not it: No one wants to pay for Trump’s border wall",
  "text": "By Jana Kasperkevic August 24, 2017 | 9:04 AM Volunteers look over the US-Mexico border fence to see how illegal border crossers may jump the fence before going on the nightly patrol. - David McNew/Getty Images The bids are in and construction on the prototypes is set to begin later this year. It would seem like the plans for President Donald Trump’s border wall with Mexico are coming along. Except for one problem: who is going to pay for it? So far, the current administration was able to scrounge up $20 million to build prototypes of the potential designs of the 30-foot tall wall. That money was previously meant to cover mobile video surveillance for Customs and Border Protection, according to a Senate report compiled by Democratic staff. That same report found that the construction of the wall was going to cost as much as $70 billion , “amounting to a total cost to every American man, woman, and child of over $200.” The lack of funding for the wall has yet to dissuade Trump from attempting to fulfill his campaign promise. Earlier this week, while speaking at a rally in Phoenix, Arizona, Trump promised thousands of supporters that the wall was coming. “If we have to close down our government, we’re building that wall,” he said on Tuesday . “One way or the other, we’re going to get that wall.” Trump has tried to come up with a few ways to pay for the wall, but so far each idea has been met with resistance. No one, it seems, wants to foot the bill. Mexico won’t pay for the wall Mexican lawmakers have said it many times — they are not paying for the wall. It got to the point where on one of the earlier calls of his presidency, Trump urged Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto to to stop saying that Mexico will not pay for the wall. “We should both say, ‘We will work it out.’ It will work out in the formula somehow,” Trump said according to transcripts obtained by the Washington Post . “As opposed to you saying, ‘We will not pay,’ and me saying, ‘We will not pay.’” On that same call, Trump told Peña Nieto that the wall “might be the most important” campaign promise Trump made, which is why he wanted to keep Peña Nieto ’s refusal to pay out of the press. “But you cannot say that to the press,” Trump said. “The press is going to go with that, and I cannot live with that.” Peña Nieto is not the only one saying no to Trump’s idea. Mexico’s former presidents, Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón, have been pretty outspoken about their stance on the issue. “I’m not going to pay for that f*cking wall! He should pay for it. He’s got the money,” Fox told Fusion, now Splinter News . Along similar lines, Calder ó n told CNBC : \"Mexican people, we are not going to pay any single cent for such a stupid wall! And they need to know that. And it's going to be completely useless.” A tax on remittances won’t pay for the wall One way that Republicans proposed to pay for the border wall is by taxing the money immigrants living in the U.S. send back home. In March, Alabama Congressman Mike Rogers introduced the “Border Wall Funding Act of 2017.” Under the bill, all person-to-person wire transfers to Mexico, Latin America and the Caribbean would come with a 2 percent tax, according to NPR . For now, the bill is stuck in committees and has yet to be voted on. Such a tax, or fee, would have to be close to 5 percent in order to raise enough money to pay for the wall, according to Alex Nowrasteh , an immigration policy analyst at the Cato Institute. He goes on to point out that this still wouldn’t work, because people would find different methods to send money back home that would avoid the tax, such as bitcoin or gift cards. Last year, Mexico received $28.5 billion in remittances from all over the world. The sun won’t pay for the wall Yet another idea floated by Trump was putting solar panels along the wall. “I’ll give you an idea that no one has heard about yet,” he said at another rally earlier this year. “We’re thinking of building the wall as a solar wall so it creates energy and pays for itself. This way, Mexico will have to pay much less money.” To figure out if this is a viable plan, Bloomberg crunched some of the numbers and found that covering the wall in solar panels could bring in about $1.52 billion a year. However, covering the wall in solar panels is not cheap. According to the Bloomberg calculations , revenue from the energy created by the wall would pay off the wall by the year 2168. That’s a couple of lifetimes away. American taxpayers won’t pay for the wall When asked whether taxpayers should foot the bill, Republican Senator John McCain said : “Taxpayers are paying a lot of money right now. One of the biggest problems we have is the enforcement of existing law.” American taxpayers do not want to pay for the wall, either. Let’s do the numbers: About 62 percent of Americans oppose building the wall, according to a poll conducted by the Pew Research Center . If the wall ends up being built, 70 percent of Americans believe the U.S. would end up paying for it. Just 16 percent think that Mexico would pick up the bill. Building the wall is not a priority for most voters. Just 26 percent of those polled by Gallup said that building the wall was an important campaign promise to keep. They’d rather see Trump improve infrastructure (69 percent), lower income taxes (54 percent), establish tariffs on foreign imports (51 percent), deport undocumented immigrants who have committed crimes (51 percent) and repeal and replace Obamacare (46 percent). Back in March, Wisconsin Congresswoman Gwen Moore proposed “No Taxpayer Funding for the Wall Act,” which would prohibit the use of federal funds for the border wall. “I am not in favor of the wall, but if there is a wall, then I do not want the United States of America to pay for the wall,” Moore told CBS . The bill is currently stuck in committees and has yet to be voted on. Related",

  "title": "Industry Movers Riding the Wave of Bitcoin's Increasing Value",
  "text": " 30 AM EDT Industry Movers Riding the Wave of Bitcoin's Increasing Value \nNEW YORK , August 24, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- \nBitcoin's recent climb above the $4,500 mark is just one example of how its market capitalization continues to gain unprecedented reach. ( http://nnw.fm/lGp8V ) From cannabis to technology, bitcoin has impacted industries far and wide, but analysts believe that the cryptocurrency isn't done climbing. A Goldman Sachs analyst recently predicted bitcoin could soon go for as high as $4,800 . ChineseInvestors.com Inc. ( OTC: CIIX ) ( CIIX Profile ) is one business taking advantage of bitcoin's success by setting up bitcoin payment acceptance through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Chinesehempoil.com Inc. ( http://nnw.fm/2ZjlL ). SinglePoint, Inc. ( OTC: SING ) also continues to develop its bitcoin cannabis payment solutions, while technology company NVIDIA Corporation ( NASDAQ: NVDA ) , graphics cards maker Advanced Micro De vices, Inc. ( NASDAQ: AMD ) , and bitcoin investment vehicle Bitcoin Investment Trust ( OTC: GBTC ) occupy their own unique positions. \nChineseInvestors.com ( OTCQB: CIIX ), in July 2017 , announced that its Chinesehempoil.com subsidiary was ready to accept bitcoin payments, in addition to more common payment methods such as debit cards and PayPal, in order to enable consumers to purchase its hemp-based health products online. The move marked CIIX's official entrance into the burgeoning digital currency market and enabled the company to offer its customers a heightened level of cost savings, privacy and ease of use. \nBy August, CIIX took its knowledge of bitcoin a step further. On par with its core operation as a provider of financial information, CIIX launched its cryptocurrency education and trading subscription service on Chinesefn.com, its dynamic financial website that provides real-time market commentary; analysis related to digital currency, trends and stocks; and education-related services to Chinese-speaking investors. The subscription service covers a spectrum of vital cryptocurrency data, including news, analysis, industry trends, price movement, sector related stocks and ETFs, and more ( http://nnw.fm/OC7Cd ). \nChineseInvestors.com ( OTCQB: CIIX ), CEO, Warren Wang , in the press release announcing the new service ( http://nnw.fm/Ifd3E ), described why providing this information to the Chinese-speaking population represents a significant market opportunity. \"With the use and trading of cryptocurrencies on the rise in Asia , it appears that a much wider adoption of digital assets may be right around the corner. With an estimated 85% market share, China is one of the dominant players controlling bitcoin volume, along with Japan (which recently legalized bitcoin as a form of payment) and the United States ,\" he explained. \"While many see the unique opportunity that cryptocurrency poses for investors and desire to capitalize on this market opportunity, they may not have a full understanding of the concept of digital currency or how the system works. CIIX intends to provide fundamental knowledge to Chinese speaking newcomers to cryptocurrency, including straightforward explanations of the basics of cryptocurrency, how to buy it and straightforward trading guidelines. For those with cryptocurrency experience, the Company will provide more detailed information regarding currency mining, blockchain technology, stock trends and ETFs. Through its innovative cryptocurrency education and trading subscription service, the Company endeavors to be the leading Chinese educational site providing up to date news and information on digital currencies.\" Headquartered in Los Angeles with offices in New York City and Shanghai , CIIX continues to grow its core as a specialized investment services company with a 100,000+ user base, providing consultation, advertising, and public relations services to China -based companies. SinglePoint, Inc. ( OTC: SING) is another cannabis industry leader participating in the cryptocurrency phenomenon. In June 2017 , the company closed a round of funding ( http://nnw.fm/7RT7g ) with an investor to support a bitcoin payments solution that was implemented in partnership with First Bitcoin Capital. By adding bitcoin payments to its diverse portfolio, SinglePoint is helping the cannabis industry - as well as other high-risk industries - overcome the challenges stemming from a lack of adequate banking access. SinglePoint also recently purchased $Weed from First Bitcoin Capital, a new currency in the market ( http://nnw.fm/C5zDj ). WeedCoin is currently listed on three exchanges, and SinglePoint said it intends to list and market the currency on more exchanges moving forward. \nTaking a step backward in the cryptocurrency process helps to understand these investment options in the alternative currency market. California -based graphics chip manufacturer and technology company NVIDIA Corporation ( NASDAQ: NVDA ) , participates in the digital currency market by providing chips used for cryptocurrency mining. While there are numerous other uses for its chips, bitcoin miners favor graphics processing units to create new cryptocurrency units. According to several industry reports, this demand helped push sales of Nvidia's graphics card line 52% higher to $1.2 billion in the second quarter. Likewise, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ( NASDAQ: AMD ) is benefitting from demand for its graphics card by cryptocurrency miners. In June, the chipmaker told CNBC that demand for its graphics cards was fueled by the 'newly resurgent cryptocurrency mining markets' ( http://nnw.fm/gbPL6 ). Earlier this week Advanced Micro Devices revealed details of its 'Radeon Software Crimson ReLive Edition Beta for Blockchain Compute' driver ( http://nnw.fm/ObGa5 ), created to help boost the efficiency of cryptocurrency mining rigs. The beta-level driver targets graphics processors that are used for mining, or a way that new transactions are added to blockchains, addressing the demand for processors used by those tapping into the cryptocurrency market. The growth and potential of bitcoin is further evidenced by Bitcoin Investment Trust ( OTCQX: GBTC ), which enables investors to gain exposure to bitcoin's price movement through a traditional investment vehicle without the challenges of buying, storing and safekeeping bitcoin. The U.S.-based, open-ended grantor trust is invested exclusively in bitcoin, and its shares are the first publicly quoted securities solely invested in and deriving value from the price of bitcoin. Bitcoin Investment Trust was recently named to OTC Markets Group's 'OTCQX Best 50' for 2017. Bitcoin digital currency has already been named an official method of payment in Japan , and it is being accepted by more and more major retailers in the United States , furthering the acceptance of bitcoin's presence as a valid payment method. \nMarket analysts continue to predict increases in bitcoin and digital currency in general. Cryptocurrency payments have benefited businesses and consumers in the cannabis products industry and in the graphics cards markets, driving growth in both sectors. Current trends show that it is also opening the door to markets worldwide, especially in the United States and China , with little signs of slowing down. This is true if pricing is any indication; bitcoin recently surged past $4,500 . \nFor more on CIIX please visit: ChineseInvestors.com (CIIX) or http://www.ChineseInvestors.com \nAbout NetworkNewsWire NetworkNewsWire (NNW) is an information service that provides to users (1) access to our news aggregation and syndication servers, (2) enhanced press release services, and (3) a full array of social communication solutions.

  "text": "New platform to enable sale and purchase of property with Bitcoin By 24th August 2017 Finance \nFor the first time, UK property can become a globally tradable asset on a peer-to-peer platform which utilises blockchain technology. \nTrustMe, a blockchain applications company, is aiming to revolutionise the global real estate market by allowing the fractional trading of individual properties using ‘asset backed certificates’ on linked, Bitcoin denominated, global property exchanges. \nThe TrustMe Property Exchange and Blockchain Land Registry will enable homeowners to trade shares (‘property certificates’) in their property on an open market as a new type of tradeable asset-class. Clients on the property exchanges will be able to purchase up to 49% of the value of a property or residential home with Bitcoin or fiat currency, whilst the 51% owner-occupier continues to live in and manage the property. Related Articles Platform cuts fixed rates \nThe first exchange will be rolled-out in London in October. \nAntony Abell, Co-Founder & Managing Director of TrustMe, commented: “The London property market, which has, for many people, long been prohibitively expensive, needs to be democratised. The TrustMe™ Property Exchanges will allow existing homeowners to unlock the value of their own house or properties and to use these assets as a form of stored liquid wealth, similar to a 30-90 day bank account, by trading as much or as little of their asset as they wish in an efficient, transparent and auditable manner. \n“It has only been the recent advent of the public blockchain that has enabled the trust that people need to have to be able to allow the most valuable assets that most will ever have in their lives to be leveraged in this way.” Join our mailing list:  ",

  "text": "GlobeNewswire - Print release Exante launches XAI, the world's first altcoin fund EXANTE, the European fintech firm that made history in 2012 by launching the world's first Bitcoin hedge fund, is once again shaking up the investment industry. Today the Malta-headquartered company launched a dedicated altcoin index, XAI, which reflects the dynamics of the altcoin world (all cryptocurrencies minus Bitcoin). The XAI-Fund, which is available to EXANTE clients immediately, follows the index, to profit from the rise in prices of most altcoins in an easy safe and regulated way. The XAI index is made up of nearly all available popular alternative cryptocurrencies. Anatoliy Knyazev, co-founder of EXANTE elaborated: 'Just a couple of weeks ago we launched separate funds for Ripple, Ethereum. Monero, Zcash and Litecoin - which was a huge success. We did notice an additional demand from clients who don't have the time or the technological means to deep-dive and analyze each currency separately - but do want to profit from the bullish altcoin markets. XAI is the solution to that problem.' EXANTE clients can trade XAI fund shares are regular exchange traded instruments and they are accessible via the general trading platform. This platform gives traders direct access to more than 50 thousand financial products and nearly all financial markets. Trading in these products, is regulated by the MFSA and audited by KPMG, adding a layer of security normally missing from the unregulated cryptocurrency market. Besides the aforementioned altcoins, the XAI-index also tracks Ethereum Classic. 'We decided to leave out Bitcoin,' said Knyazev, 'since it has less fat left on its bone. Ripple and Monero, for example, nearly doubled in value recently. That's what makes investing in the XAI fund so interesting and exciting.' -END-",

  "text": "ADVERTISEMENTS Share with: Russian startup DARFChain , (Distributed Accounting, Resource and Financial System in Blockchain) a pre-ICO revolutionizing ERP to control and audit post-ICO projects, has received authorization of its DARF token as a verified asset of a DEX – decentralized exchange. The token operates on the Waves Blockchain platform. The token can now be openly traded on the exchange including with Bitcoin and euro. Remarkably, DARF increased its value even before the start of the official ICO. DARFChain, founded by Stanislav Taktaev and Konstantin Bakulev, demonstrated during testing the possibility of synchronizing distributed data of ERP with the use of Blockchain technology. Crypto entrepreneurs are seeking to raise the level of transparency and the degree of confidence in their ICO project, as well as crowd investors who want to control the project supported by them, receive a reliable tool for their work. The development was carried out on the Waves Blockchain platform using the ODOO ERP system and the BigchainDB database. The significance of DARFChain’s accomplishment of developing the token for ERP-systems on the block for the development of the digital economy has already been written by the Russian Forbes. Well-known entrepreneurs in the global IT community Pavel Vrublevsky and Yegor Ryzhikov believe that modern digital mechanisms for ensuring business transparency in a trusted environment will open new opportunities for the development of a global network of local economies.

  "title": "Bitcoin: The Timeliness of the Invisible Coin That Generates Confidence! — Steemit",
  "text": "Bitcoin: The Timeliness of the Invisible Coin That Generates Confidence! 4 hours ago 49 in bitcoin \nThe secrets of digital tickets. The impact in Argentina. The blockchain and the creation of a new Internet. \nThe digital society now goes through the pillar of all economy: the representation of Value. From the beginning of history, how to represent value was essential and as solutions were achieved the exchange of trade helped societies to evolve in an accelerated way. But it was Richard Nixon, the American president, who in the 1960s struck hard at the concept of paper money: he established that the dollar was no longer convertible into gold. Without entering into technical details, the dollar, the key exchange currency globally, is only a wallpaper that is not convertible to anything, but sustained in a huge dose of confidence in the American economy. After the subprime mortgage crisis, the federal reserve issued billions of dollars and many wondered how far the monetary party could go. \n\nTrust. In the digital society they understood that the Value needed a new representative, one that does not depend on the whims of the current government, a new pattern to represent Value that is available around the world. That employer should not even be valuable by himself, nor should he care who created him. The crucial thing, however, was to create trust, a trust that does not depend on anyone. And so, someone whose identity is unknown, in 2008 a white paper (a technical explanation but easily understood by experts) to the network giving birth simultaneously to two facts: a technology known as Blockchain or block chain, and the first Criptomoneda who used it: Bitcoin. \n\nThe coin is analogous to a physical ticket, it has to be stored in one place, it can be in the personal computer or in a service in the cloud known as wallets. And they have a pair of keys, one public and one private. The private is known only by the owner and the public is the one that is made known to the other party to make the transfers, \"said Diego Gutiérrez Zaldivar, president of the NGO Bitcoin Argentina. If the private key is lost or the personal computer is broken or stolen, bitcoins can not be recovered. That's a plus in favor of using cloud services. There are those who a few years ago lost his notebook with 5,000 BTC and laughed at the conferences bitcoins telling the story, the market value at that time were about US $ 2,000, the value of your laptop. Today is $ 200 million dollars. They say that they no longer laugh or tell the story. It is that bitcoin broke all the forecasts starting to quote for fractions of penny, in 2009, to the record of the US $ 4,000 reached today. \nIn Argentina there is a boil over the issue as it is a country that has always suffered with its monetary policy. Here, the Central Bank often changes market rules in a drastic and arbitrary way, limiting long-term investment appetite. The birth of Bitcoin allows us to think of new forms of investment that are more independent of our historical pendular policy, \"says Daniel Nofal, shareholder of IPlan. \nThe market value and the reputation of bitcoin were growing in such a way that many businesses accepted it and at present practically anything can be bought in BTC: from a house to a pet. But the reality is that the currency is not used so much for those purposes as a way to protect value, as is done with gold coins. The transactional use does appear in the darkweb, the hidden web where the addresses are not public like the one that is accessed from the browser. There are transactions for drugs, kidnappings, murders and all kinds of illegal services. Also this modality occupied the headlines with wannacry, a malware that sequestered thousands of computers around the world encrypting its information that would only free through the payment of a rescue in bitcoins. \nWith eight years in the market can no longer be said to be a fad in the style of PókemonGo. However, the currency experienced its great moment of uncertainty two weeks ago when it was fragmented into two versions: Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. The great success of the currency forced a technological update to be able to make more transactions in less time. But since there is no central authority in this system that authorizes the change, the different nodes of the network must authorize the improvement by consensus. \nHowever, there was one group that did not accept the change with which the bitcoin chain was opened in two new currencies. \"The market value of both currencies - the owners started to have the same amount of BTC and bitcoin cash - instead of lowering as was feared continued to rise and reached a new historical record. The rise may be related to the fact that the separation of the currencies did not alter the operation of Bitcoin and, therefore, disarticulated markets' fears that the hardfork (the bankruptcy) was a threat to the continuity of Bitcoin, in Segwit was activated the technological improvement that had taken two years of waiting, \"says Gutiérrez Zaldivar. \n\nIdeas. It should be noted that Bitcoin is just a cryptomoneda among many possible. At present there are more than a thousand coins that use their own blockchain implementation. This technology is conformed by a chain of blocks that can not be modified once published and that are linked to a previous block. \"Blockhain allows us to build trust within the network at multiple levels whose uses go beyond what a currency is,\" said Pablo Junco, director of business development at Microsoft. In fact, these chains can be used for totally innovative uses. \"I'm surprised by the idea of ​​Smart Contracts or smart contracts: the possibility of setting a collection / payment algorithm that runs automatically. It can serve large companies for internal processes such as intercompany payments and for small companies can be the way to expand their business operations lowering costs and risks, \"says Nofal. Among other experimental uses that are being seen is an exps such as Crowdjury a web platform that allows to resolve disputes quickly, economically and transparently. For this, it uses a combination of technologies like blockchain, crowdsourcing and artificial intelligence. \"If Julia from Argentina hires Miguel from Guatemala through a freelancers platform and there is conflict, there is no simple solution. Going to a lawyer in Guatemala is too expensive. Now if the contract originally signed had a clause that says that, in any conflict, it will settle in Crowdjury. The agreement and the product are automatically sent to a jury of experts who have the appropriate skills to evaluate the evidence. Each jury analyzes the evidence and votes who is right. \nJury selection is done with advanced game theory concepts to ensure that they are chosen in a completely transparent manner and that they have the right incentives to vote for who is really right (and not be bribed). The technology that allows juries to be chosen in a transparent way is precisely the blockchain, \"exemplifies Federico Ast CEO of Crowdjury. \nThe new uses that are found since the appearance of Blockchain cause many are thinking of the emergence of a new Internet that could threaten or at least change to the central authorities of the Internet at the moment, that is to say with Google and Facebook in first place. It is that these companies monetizan the content and the activities that generates the user without that they receive nothing in return. Many of the new ideas are being thought of in the sense of creating rewards more in line with the value that each brings. The technology is so flexible that every company could create its currency. What's more, each individual user could do it. According to the value that is contributed that coin will be successful or not but potentially there can be as many coins as people, something totally impossible just a few years ago. \nPlease Resteem and Upvote!

  "text": "Canada regulators say most crypto currency offerings need oversight Thursday, August 24, 2017 2:26 p.m. EDT FILE PHOTO: Bitcoin (virtual currency) coins are seen in an illustration picture taken at La Maison du Bitcoin in Paris, France, May 27, 201 \nBy Alastair Sharp \nTORONTO (Reuters) - Canadian securities regulators on Thursday said many Canadian crypto currency offerings they have studied involve the sale of securities and should abide by tough existing rules unless otherwise granted exemptions. \nCrypto currencies such as bitcoin and a growing stream of alternatives allow anonymous peer-to-peer transactions without the need for banks or central banks. They are also used by companies seeking to raise capital, in the form of initial coin offerings (ICOs) or initial token offerings (ITOs). \nThe currencies exist in a legal gray area, however, with regulators scrambling to come up with rules that will not stifle innovative funding models while also protecting investors. \nThe Canadian Securities Administers, an umbrella group of provincial watch-dogs, said any coin or token whose value is tied to the future profits or success of a business will likely be considered a security, while those providing access to a specific good, such as the ability to play a video game, may not. \n\"With the offerings that we have reviewed to date, we have in many instances found that the coins/tokens in question constitute securities for the purposes of securities laws, including because they are investment contracts,\" the regulators said in a statement. \n(http://www.osc.gov.on.ca/documents/en/Securities-Category4/csa_20170824_cryptocurrency-offerings.pdf) \nExecutives and advisers to the country's growing fintech industry criticized the statement for not offering enough clarity. \n\"There still is a lot of gray area in terms of the guidance on when a crypto currency or token would be a security,\" said Daniel Fuke, a partner in the securities and M&A group at Fasken Martineau who is advising companies, including CoinSquare, a crypto currency marketplace. \n\"It would be nice if we could know from CSA what they were thinking in terms of some of the sub-considerations of the securities law test.\" \nIn July, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said tokens issued through ICOs can be considered securities, meaning they would fall under disclosure laws and be subject to regulatory scrutiny unless a \"valid exemption\" applies. \nKik Interactive, a Waterloo, Ontario-based company launching a digital currency called Kin so its messaging customers can use a range of digital services, said it is working to ensure Kin is classified as a utility token, not a security. \nTo date, no business has issued a prospectus to complete an initial coin or token offering in Canada, nor has any crypto currency exchange been recognized or exempted from recognition in Canada, the regulators said. \n(Reporting by Alastair Sharp; Editing by Dan Grebler) More From Technology ",

The REX Bitcoin Strategy ETF and REX Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF will both be actively managed and will not invest directly in bitcoin. The former will offer long exposure to bitcoin, while the latter will aim to capture short performance. \nBoth funds are slated to list on the Bats exchange, which is owned by ETF.com’s parent company, CBOE. The filing did not include tickers or expense ratios. \nSimilar Fund \nRather than investing in actual bitcoin, the ETFs will invest in bitcoin-related financial instruments, primarily futures contracts. The filing, at least for the long exposure fund, is strikingly similar to that of the VanEck Vectors Bitcoin Strategy ETF that was put into registration earlier this month. \nHowever, the REX ETFs’ prospectus notes that the notional value of its bitcoin exposure will be roughly 100% of the total fund assets. \nAs with the VanEck filing, the REX ETFs will make use of a wholly owned subsidiary domiciled in the Cayman Islands. The subsidiary can represent up to 25% of the fund’s total assets. \nIn addition to futures, the funds can also invest in swap agreements, other ETFs, exchange-traded notes, fixed income and cash or cash equivalents, the prospectus said. \nContact Heather Bell at [email protected]",

  "text": "Generic 23 August 2017 | 0 Comments \nWASHINGTON STATE: For the first time Washington NORML had a regular lobbyist in Olympia this year. The truth is NORML has almost always been staffed by volunteer activists. That’s what I was, at a NORML chapter in Missouri, interning for NORML’s national office in Washington DC, and later as head of NORML’s Thurston County chapter. The reward I got from it was doing the right thing, great stories, and lifelong friends. (Oh, as an intern NORML reimbursed subway fare.) \nI was shocked when Kevin Oliver , the head of Washington NORML, said he’d raised some money to hire a lobbyist. But the professional he had in mind wanted it all, and didn’t believe the legislature would pass home growing of cannabis by adults, so wasn’t going to try. I promised to do it for much less, and give a damn about the things recreational consumers care about because I was one. I’ve lobbied as a citizen, but doing this as a job was another level. \nLobbying part time along with a second job I got up close and personal with a lot of bills. What did I do, and what changed? My focus this session broke down into five areas: Securing fair permitting for on-site cannabis use by for adults 21 and older. A draft bill to allow special permits for marijuana consumption events was drafted and shopped around to various members. Despite bipartisan interest failed to find a primary sponsor in time. However, a previous bill to allow cigar bars may be adapted to include marijuana on-site consumption. This leaves two avenues for social use, at a time that the policy is expanding among legal cannabis states. Securing cannabis homegrow protections and establishing a system of seed/clone sale for adults 21 and older. Two bills were heard this session to legalize personal cultivation, HB 1092 & 1212. HB 1212 passed unanimously out of Commerce & Gaming, and through the Rules review to the Finance committee, the farthest any such bill has progressed in the state. I searched for a sponsor for a draft bill to allow seed/clone sales to adults, making the law continent on personal cultivation being enacted this year. Apathy in the state senate slowed progress along with lingering questions about enforcement needs and federal intervention. In SB5131, the LCB has been mandated to produce a report on personal cultivation for the legislature by December. Beyond submitting information and rallying stakeholders, WA NORML will be looking for the best ways to raise consumer influence in this report, without which, it’s recommendations may not be trustworthy. Promote taxation/regulatory reforms that will benefit adult cannabis consumers. With the passage of an organic-like certification for cannabis products, legalized sharing/gifting of cannabis, expanded hemp access and use in consumer products, and regulation of infused edible production that is closer to other food industries, there are several ways in which the legal consumer will be better off with the changes in this session. Particularly the sharing/gifting of cannabis, while not a source of many arrests, remained a blindspot and common complaint against our legal framework. Promote reforms that will increase access and security in the sale of medically affordable compliant cannabis to patients/caregivers. Patient access to legal clones/seeds will be larger due to laws passed this year. Involving a rules process takes time, new laws will bring greater availability and stability to patients and caregivers producing their own medicine. Similarly to regular consumers, patients will also benefit from the organic-like certification, as recreational plant testing is often deemed inadequate for patient needs. Maddie’s Law, which would assist patient-students medicating on school property passed the house with broad support, and initially had senate momentum, but senate leadership halted progress and kept the bill from a floor vote. However, it’s simple change and broad popularity leave it well positioned to be addressed in the future, particularly as the U.S. Congress has maintained a ban on DEA interference in state-legal medical programs. Working to improve legislation where possible and oppose when necessary. An unfortunate reality is that some of the biggest victories this year were stopping damaging bills or amendments. In other cases objections were ignored. Nonetheless, opposition to billboard bans, increased public consumption penalties, increased packaging/concentrate penalties, banning of bitcoin, and retail bans in Alcohol Impact Areas helped keep these issues from advancing. Other areas like out-of-state financial stake, or increased licensee fees were opposed but amended into other legislation. While not perfect, success in stopping bad legislation is crucial to stemming any prohibition resurgence. \nMost of my efforts were on HB1212, HB1060, ESSB5131, and searching for sponsors for two draft bills on seed sale and social use permitting. I also testified, signed in with a position available to answer questions at legislative hearings, submitted written materials, or spoke with lawmakers about the following bills: \nMedical Cannabis Bills- \nPro: HB1098, HB1094, HB1060/SB5290, HB2021 Con: SB5933 \nRecreational Cannabis Bill- \nPro: HB1092, HB1099, HB1212, HB1124, HB1461/SB5323, HB1462 (enacted) /SB5324 Con: HB1416, HB1065, HB1151, SB5282 Other: HB1250 (enacted) \nHemp Bills- \nPro: HB1692 Other: HB2064 (enacted) \nResearch/Misc. Bills- \nPro: HB1895 Other: SB5131 (enacted) \nChanges from Enacted bills- \nHB2064- Removing industrial hemp from the scope of the uniform controlled substances act. \nRemoving hemp from Washington’s CSA is positive in that it makes an ecologically and industrially beneficial plant available. However it’s lack of rules damage long term viability of the industry and outdoor cannabis grows with the risk of cross-pollination, absence of certified seed programs, and absent research component as required by Sec. 7606 of the federal Farm Bill. Amendments in SB5131, and recent rules proposed by the Washington State Dept. of Agriculture, should establish some hemp licensing, research parameters, and use in marijuana products but a seed certification program still depends on some federal cooperation. \nHB1250- Authorizing retail marijuana outlets to give a free lockable drug box to adults age twenty-one years and over and to qualifying patients age eighteen years and over subject to restrictions. \nBy updating RCW 69.50.357, this bill allows retailers to “donate the lockable boxes and provide the related literature to any person eligible to purchase marijuana products” that they receive from a third party entity. Nothing in the law requires person eligible to buy anything in order to receive a lockbox and literature, and retailers are allowed to sell lockboxes (assuming they weren’t donated to the retailer) as well as distribute lockboxes that have been donated. I lobbied for the term “upon request” to be added so that consumers who actively want to store cannabis in lockboxes will get them versus the first customer offered a free item. \nHB1462- Adding authority to the department of agriculture to regulate sanitary processing of marijuana-infused edibles. \nThis bill creates an edible endorsement for processors and greater authority for the Dept. of Agriculture to regulate infused edibles similar to that agencies other food handling regulation. While edible production was within the scope of licensed processors with approved facilities, those licensees will now need this endorsement with a separate application/renewal process all edible sales. This will involve Dept. of Agriculture adopting rules specifically for marijuana edibles, with an understanding “Such rules must be written and interpreted to be consistent with rules adopted by the board [LCB] and the department of health.” By April 1st, 2018 rules will regulate edibles similar to other food handling licenses with some exceptions including: issuance of the endorsement in lieu of a food processing license through the Dept. of Ag. business licensing system; separate penalty schedule to operate in addition to the penalty schedule of the LCB; must be obtained by any licensee that “processes, packages, or makes marijuana-infused edibles;” endorsement renewal will coincide with marijuana processors license renewal, but must already hold processors license before initial issuance. The licensee needs a separate endorsement for each location, and no facility can be used to process non-marijuana infused foods except “solely for tasting samples or internal product testing.” \nSB5131- Addressing provisions concerning marijuana with respect to research licenses, local authority notifications, the retail licensing application process, processor wholesale events, and jurisdictional requirements. \nJust signed into law by Gov. Inslee. I’ve written extensively on this bill for MJNewsNetwork, and have described it as “omnicannabis” because it is multiple bills addressing a wide variety of issues. Here’s a brief overview of what it does: \n-Medical Garden Access: Allows licensed marijuana producers to sell immature cannabis plants, clones, and seeds to qualifying patients who enter the state’s medical marijuana database. A close reading of Sec. 11 suggests authorized but unregistered patients may be able to buy seeds, this may be allowed or banned by LCB rules process. \n-Homegrow Report: The LCB must examine the viability of allowing recreational users to grow their own marijuana, with the enforcement priorities outlined in the Cole Memo as the central guidelines for their recommendation. \n-Retail License Limit: A retailer or individual “with a financial or other ownership interest in” a retail license can own up to five retail licenses. \n-Forfeiting Licenses: Require the LCB forfeit retail licenses which have been issued but are not operational and open to the public unless the delay is due to circumstances beyond the licensee’s control, for example if the licensee has been unable to open because of a local moratorium, ban, or because zoning, licensing or other regulatory measures prevent it from opening. \n-Gifting Marijuana: Adults can deliver marijuana each other in half the legal possession amounts so long as the pot is offered as a gift without financial remuneration so long as the marijuana shared is either in it’s original packaging, or not in public view. \n-Tribal Oversight: The LCB must get approval from a federally recognized Indian Tribe prior to granting a license on tribal land. \n-Licensing Contracts & Disclosure: Allow a licensees to enter into agreements or consulting contracts “with any individual, partnership, employee cooperative, association, nonprofit corporation, or corporation” for goods or services, trademarks, trade secrets or proprietary information. The agreement must be disclosed to the LCB, but various information and financial considerations are exempt from the state’s Public Disclosure Act. \n-Organic-Equivalent Pot: The LCB is instructed to adopt regulations for marijuana similar to products federally certified as organic. The LCB will implement regulations for marijuana to be grown similar to organic products. These products will have a uniform title and labeling. \n-Processing Hemp: The LCB must study the viability of letting licensed processors process industrial hemp. This may lead to legislation to allow processors to purchase plant material from farmers licensed to grow hemp. \n-Advertising: Significant changes focused on advertising to kids. Prohibits licensees from taking “any action directly or indirectly to target youth in the advertising, promotion, or marketing of marijuana and marijuana products, or take any action the primary purpose of which is to initiate, maintain, or increase the incidence of youth use of marijuana or marijuana products.” This includes prohibiting toys, movie/cartoon characters, or images that would pique underage interest in pot. It also bans using commercial mascots, as defined to mean “a live human being, animal, or mechanical device used for attracting the attention of motorists and passersby so as to make them aware of marijuana products or the presence of a marijuana business.” This covers staff in costume, inflatable tube displays, or sign spinners. Cities and counties can further restrict advertising, but must enforce extra limits themselves. \n-Billboards: A marijuana retailer may now only use a billboard to identify the name or nature of the business and directions to its location. Outdoor signs could not contain depictions of marijuana plants, products, or images that appeal to children. Outdoor advertising would be prohibited in “arenas, stadiums, shopping malls, fairs that receive state allocations, farmers markets, and video game arcades.” An exception allows outdoor advertising at adult-only events. \nAs you see, I got a lot done, and I had help and support, but faced off with a lot of professional lobbyists whose careers or relationships in Olympia go a long way. There are bad lobbyists and corrupt special interests. But typically, with them comes big money and disproportionate influence. I talked with a woman earlier this year who said she wouldn’t trust any marijuana activist that got paid to lobby. I told her I understood, then shook her hand and told her I hoped she had just met one she could trust. I hope being open and clear about what I did, didn’t do, or hoped to do offers a small gesture that I mean well, even if I’m not the slickest salesman ever. Cannabis consumers care about fair influence after generations of laws being made ABOUT them but not WITH them. \nAre there other lobbyists publicize the oversight of themselves? Maybe, but I’ve never met any who did. In my first article about my lobbying here at MJNewsNetwork , I explained that you can find my lobbyist reporting to the state’s Public Disclosure Commission here: \nI’m honored and humbled that any group would pay me to lobby for better pot laws. I dream of doing that more often than gaining online fame. But between my wife and me, we have a full time job, three part time jobs, and one car to get us to them. My payment from Washington NORML is a matter of record, and has been very generous, but it’s not making me rich. \nThat’s fine, my getting rich is not the point. Our fight is far from over, but the battlefield is different, and organizing protests or petitions is costlier and won’t engage a voting public that largely finds pot accessible and available. Traditional lobbying carries risks, no doubt, and it’s not the same as flipping off the status quo for it’s many oppressive practices. But supporting consumer lobbying is going to get more wins in legal states than future statewide ballot efforts. The point is that the marijuana community should work together and support traditional lobbying in places with legal pot. It’s not as exciting or visible, but it’s crucial. \nThe problem with gains is they have to be maintained. I’ll be speaking up for home grow, or any other legislation that makes sense next year, no matter what. I don’t know if WA NORML will have support to pay me, or anyone, to lobby. I’ll do what I can, but don’t know what time I’ll have left to do it. This has always been the struggle of volunteer activists, but these are gains worth maintaining, hopefully cannabis consumers will support WA NORML the way WA NORML has supported them (and me). \nFollow WA NORML of Facebook and Twitter",

  "text": "US Bitcoin Price Watch; Riding The Upside Wave Posted on 5:15 pm August 24, 2017 Author Samuel Rae Categories Analysis , Bitcoin , Bitcoin Analysis Tags bitcoin , Bitcoin chart , bitcoin price , btcusd , trade bitcoin Here's a look at what we are focusing on in the bitcoin price this evening. SPONSORED ARTICLE: Tech Analysis articles are sponsored by SimpleFX - Simple as Never Before, SimpleFX is a robust online trading provider, offering trading with Forex CFDs on Bitcoins, Litecoins, indices, precious metals and energy. Offers simple and transparent trading conditions. \nThe European session is coming to a close and it’s time to take the second of our twice-daily looks at what’s happening on the narrow timeframe charts in the bitcoin price. Action throughout the session today fell pretty much in line with our expectations as outlined in this morning’s coverage. Specifically, we noted that we would likely see a breakout of the consolidation that dominated overnight and that – if we did get a breakout of this type – we could enter in line with some pretty substantial momentum. \nWith any luck, we will see a continuation of this upside momentum overnight on Thursday and – further – as we head into the weekend. So, with this in mind, let’s get some levels in place with which we can attempt to draw a profit in the market whether we get the type of action we are looking for or not. As ever, take a quick look at the chart below before we get started. It is a one-minute candlestick chart and it has our range overlaid in red. \nAs the chart shows, the range we’re looking at for the session this evening comes in as defined by support to the downside at 4210 and resistance to the upside at 4246. We are going to address the upside trade first as this is in line with the overarching momentum. So, if we see a break above resistance, we will enter long towards an immediate upside target of 4270. A stop loss on the trade around 4236 works to define risk. \nLooking the other way, if we get a close below support, we will jump in short towards a downside target of 4190. On this one, a stop loss somewhere in the region of 4215 will ensure we are taken out of the position in the event of a bias reversal. \nChart courtesy of Trading View Disclaimer: The information contained herein is not guaranteed, does not purport to be comprehensive and is strictly for information purposes only.

Xinhua alleges that Huobi and Okcoin collectively invested approximately 1b yuan ($150 m USD) into “wealth-management products”, citing recent investigations made into the activities of cryptocurrency exchanges by the People’s Bank of China. \nOkcoin has issued a statement refuting the allegations, stating “we at OKCoin have a strict policy of placing idle client funds into lower-risk banking products. This policy is in keeping with general practices in the banking and securities industry, for both the purpose of safeguarding clients funds.” Huobi is yet to issue a statement regarding the allegations. \nXinhua has since published an editorial piece advocating for greater government regulation in the face of increasing dynamism within the cryptocurrency sphere. “New things are developing so fast that regulations must keep pace,” Xinhuan states, before expounding that authorities go to greater lengths to shut down bitcoin exchanges suspected of “dubious” operations. Ascertaining the Validity of Xinhua’s Claims Has Become Difficult Due to the Absence of Further Documentation Supporting the Allegations \nAscertaining the validity of Xinhua’s claims has become difficult due to the absence of further documentation supporting the allegations. Western media has been unable to access a key People’s Bank of China report cited in the article, and further details regarding the investment products that hosted clients funds are unavailable. \nQuartz has reported that Beijing-based bitcoin exchange employees have revealed that cryptocurrency exchanges have become subject to increasing regulatory scrutiny following the People’s Bank of China’s crackdown on leading cryptocurrency exchanges, included mandatory reporting to China’s central bank. \nDo you think that the major Chinese bitcoin exchanges are likely to have been engaging in high-risk investments using client funds?

At time of writing, blocks were being found every two minutes. \nA coming difficulty adjustment is expected in about two days, at which point bitcoin cash should once again be much less profitable to mine than bitcoin. \nChain image via Shutterstock The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies .

First Bitcoin Capital’s shares are traded over-the-counter, and prior to the suspension were trading at $1.79 apiece, according to data from Bloomberg . \nThe SEC said that it was moving to suspend trading because of concerns over the information published by First Bitcoin Capital, including the value of the assets it claims to possess. \nThe agency wrote in its suspension notice: \n“The Commission temporarily suspended trading in the securities of BITCF because of concerns regarding the accuracy and adequacy of publicly available information about the company including, among other things, the value of BITCF’s assets and its capital structure. This order was entered pursuant to Section 12(k) of the Exchange Act.” \nAccording to its website, the Canada-based firm operates a number of cryptocurrency-related business lines, including a bitcoin exchange and a network of ATMs. First Bitcoin Capital did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nThe move represents the second cryptocurrency-related suspension initiated by the SEC this month. \nAs CoinDesk previously reported , the agency issued a suspension on the shares of CIAO Group, an OTC-traded firm, over concerns about statements regarding an upcoming initial coin offering (ICO). \nStop light image via Shutterstock The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is an independent media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies .

  "title": "Important Questions I Have About SteemIt And DTube (And Others Probably Do Too) — Steemit",
  "text": "Important Questions I Have About SteemIt And DTube (And Others Probably Do Too) 20 hours ago 59 in dtube Watch Important Questions I Have About SteemIt And DTube (And Others Probably Do Too video on DTube Hello friends!\nWelcome to my second DTube video! \nThe first video I uploaded took a long time to propagate/process (at least for me). It appears that others were able to view the video within minutes of uploading, but for some reason I was not able to. \nYesterday was the first time I could get the video to play for me, and even then only the audio played. \nThere are a few reasons for my video today. \nFirst and foremost, I wanted to try using my webcam instead of my camcorder to create the video. I also decided to compress the video to keep the file size small in hopes that would help the video to propagate/process faster. \nThe second reason is to see if I can get both the video and audio to work. I'm hoping that using my webcam might fix that problem. I kept the video in MP4 format and recorded in 720p rather than 1080p in order to keep the file size down. \nAlso, I did not edit this video at all prior to uploading. I'm trying to determine whether or not it may have been my editing software that caused the video to malfunction. I use the VSDC editor to put the finishing touches on my videos, and I love it, so I hope that's not an issue. \nThe third reason for this video is to hopefully finally get my reputation over the \"59\" reputation hump, which it seems like I've been stuck on FOREVER! Getting to 60 would be a HUGE milestone for me on SteemIt, and I'm really looking forward to that happening. \nLastly, and probably most importantly, I'm looking for information on how to turn Steem into actual money that I can spend. As I've stated in my first video, I am not looking to withdraw anytime soon. I'm a firm believer that Steem is only going to rise, and so I'm in it for the long haul. \nHowever, since I have not opened an account at an exchange site and do not yet have a wallet, I am looking for advice from those who have actually turned their Steem into spendable cash. By \"spendable cash,\" I am referring to money that they have had deposited into their bank accounts and are able to withdraw at will. \nSo far, the two biggest exchange sites that people have recommended are Bittrex and Poloniex. As for a wallet, lots of people seem to like Coinbase. Also, I have heard that a lot of people like the \"Shift\" Visa card that Coinbase offers, which allows you to spend Bitcoin anywhere Visa is accepted. \nSo, as you can see, this video is intended to answer a few questions that I have and also to hopefully provide me with the best settings and formats to upload videos to DTube. \nAlso, please FEEL FREE to share links to any SteemIt articles that you think can help me with these questions, especially how to turn Steem into cash. That would be super helpful. \nAlso, can anyone comment on whether or not we can use markup language in our video descriptions? I know that simply posting a URL makes a clickable link, but I'm curious to find out if you can use markup or HTML in the description like you can when writing an article on SteemIt. Since there does not seem to be an option to go back and edit the description after posting, I'm afraid to put anything in that I may not be able to remove or change later on. \nI have noticed that when you post a video to DTube, it automatically creates a post on SteemIt, which is great. However, editing the post on SteemIt will change the SteemIt post, but does not affect the DTube video description. I'm sure that one of the goals of the DTube creators is going to be the option to edit and/or delete videos, but I'm not sure when that will go into effect. \nAlso, how about images? Can images be posted in the DTube video description area? Does anyone know or has anyone tried it? \nI would like to thank all of you for taking the time to watch the video and answer questions. \nI'm hoping that many others also have the same questions, and that this video will serve as a good reference for all! \nMy first Dtube video: https://dtube.video/v/contentking/lpz1d26m \nIf you'd like to follow me, you can do so here: https://steemit.com/@contentking \nHope to be back with another video soon! 20 hours ago by contentking 59 ",
