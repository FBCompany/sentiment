      "text": "Read More in Data Center » 35 Blockchain Startups to Watch Blockchain startups are enjoying great funding and excitement. Indeed, the hype for blockchain is matched only by the support for it. \nAnd: Blockchain's Future \nThere’s a reason that blockchain startups are hot. Technologies come and go over the years and raise their share of hype, but few can match the enthusiasm that has been shown for blockchain technology. \nBlockchain is the brainchild of Satoshi Nakamoto, who may or may not be real and may or may not be one person or a group of people. All that is known is that Nakamoto is also the brains behind Bitcoin . Blockchain is in fact the technology behind Bitcoin but the two are totally separate. Blockchain provides the means to record and store Bitcoin transactions, but the blockchain technology has many uses beyond Bitcoin. \nBlockchains are distributed ledgers, and they accept input from many different parties. So think of them as something akin to a Wikipedia page, where anyone can edit it. Unlike Wikipedia, where one person can change a page, a blockchain ledger can only be changed by people within the group who have permissions. \nWith a permissioned blockchain, each participant has a unique identity, and their identity has permissions of what they can and cannot do. Blockchain uses policies to constrain network participation and access to transaction details. \nSo unlike Wikipedia, there is no need for central control. If someone makes a bad or negative entry to a Wikipedia page, the admins can undo it. That is not the case with blockchain, where the distribution database is done by consensus where every node in the blockchain network comes to the same conclusion about a record. You get the ability to make changes to a Blockchain by ownership of a private key for authentication. Blockchain Startups \nThere are many other potential uses, as the many blockchain startups in this list will show. This list, as long as it is, is by no means complete. Yet here are 35 blockchain startups worth watching – and many more are entering the field. \n1) ICOBox \nInitial Coin Offerings (ICOs) are means to launch a new cryptocurrency, like BitCoin, except they sell ownership or royalties to a project instead of money. ICOBox provides SaaS solutions for conducting ICOs. A standard ICOBox package consists of three modules: a technology solution for deploying and managing tokens; a legal solution for handling contractual documents and token legal concept review; and a marketing solution with s a preset marketing strategy, advertising traffic budget, critical public relations recommendations, and a bounty program setup. \n2) Ethereum \nOkay, not exactly a startup, rather an emerging platform. Ethereum is the leading blockchain platform for ICOs with more than 50% market share and many companies listed here are Ethereum-based. Ethereum is a decentralized software platform that enables development of blockchain-based SmartContracts and Distributed Applications (DApps). It’s a platform and programming language that helps developers build apps without any downtime, fraud, control or interference from a third party. \n3) Filecoin \nFilecoin is a distributed storage cloud that uses unused storage space on individual computers and server farms for cryptographic \"tokens\" managed by blockchain. People providing storage are called \"miners\" and receive Filecoin in exchange for allowing their storage to be used by customers, called \"clients.\" The more storage miners provide, the more they are paid in tokens, based on BitCoin. \n4) Consensys Systems \nConsensys Systems builds decentralized applications on the Ethereum blockchain that could threaten major industries. It has a distributed accounting system, prediction markets for business, sports, and entertainment; an open energy market; a distributed music model to compete with Apple and Spotify; and a suite of business tools for mass collaboration, mass creation and mass management of a management-less company. \n5) Chain Inc. \nChain creates a suite of blockchain-based tools for banks, stock exchanges, credit-card companies and other major banking industry firms to enable them to move, store, trade and manage financial assets quickly, securely all via blockchain. The Chain platform enables banks and financial institutions to create, issue, store and transfer digital assets on private, purpose-built networks for a given market. \n6) Abra \nAbra is building a global digital asset-management system for electronic payments that can clear instantly, instead of taking days like with legacy services such as Western Union. It allows people to convert physical money to Bitcoin for transfers as well. \n7) Bitfury \nFounded in 2011, Bitfury is an older firm that started as a mining company but has since evolved into a fully integrated, full-service blockchain security and technology firm. It has both proprietary hardware and software solutions for secure transfer of digital assets, along with analytics. \n9) Herosphere \nHerosphere serves the betting industry through its Ethereum-based online prediction platform. It allows for trustless betting, so two or more parties can interact and fulfill contracts without having to know or trust each other. \n10) OpenFund \nOpenFund is a decentralized and completely transparent crypto investment platform on Ethereum that relies on crowdsourcing rather than financial bankers or venture capitalists to choose what startups they invest in. Users use the company’s cryptocurrency to vote on specific assets they want funded and the platform distributes the funds based on the majority opinion of the crowd. \n11) LAToken \nA Liquidity Asset Token is a blockchain-based way to access cash from the things you own, like taking a second mortgage on your house for money. LAToken lets you extend that concept to your house, your car, or anything else of value that you own. \n12) Kalpa Digital Health \nThe Kalpa, as it is called, is an independent, authenticated and easy-to-access global health care database using BlockChain Technology to enable individuals to access their personal health and medical records, regardless of geographical or organizational boundaries. So you can be anywhere in the world and have full access to your medical records. \n13) DMarket \nThe videogame world has seen a huge growth in the sale of in-game items. Many online games such as World of Warcraft allow players to buy gear with real cash, and there has existed an aftermarket of sellers of in-game gear. DMarket is a cross-game marketplace that enables gamers to trade any virtual item from any game on any platform. Its API will allow for one-click in-game sales through BitCoin rather than PayPal, the payment method of choice now. \n14) Qvolta \nQvolta is a P2P cryptocurrency-fiat exchange platform and mobile application that allows people to buy and sell Bitcoins and Ethereum using local popular payment methods. The platform will transform the way people deal with cryptocurrencies, promising a secure, user-friendly P2P-exchange solution poised for mass adoption. \n15) Propy \nPropy.com, is a peer-to-peer real estate exchange platform built on blockchain technology claiming to be the world’s first Global Property Store with Decentralized Title Registry. Propy is the world’s first international real-estate marketplace designed for purchasing property across borders. The team at Propy.com facilitates connections between international entities to enable the seamless purchase of international real-estate online for the first time. \n16) Vault One \nIts product Vault One Solution is a method for securing sensitive data on a private Ethereum blockchain. It addresses Privileged Account Management (PAM) by integrating Ethereum alongside traditional security methods, like passwords, private keys, and other traditional security methods. This means no more data breaches caused by compromised passwords and a fully traceable history of who accessed the server and what information they obtained. \n17) DECENT \nDECENT is a blockchain-based content distribution platform going up against giants like Apple and Amazon by offering content creators full profits from their work, instead of losing 30% or more when sold through iTunes or Amazon. DECENT’s blockchain is designed to incorporate every content format imaginable. \n18) AirFox \nAirfox is leveraging blockchain to make mobile data more affordable and accessible to millions of people around the world using a new cryptocurrency called AirTokens that will be redeemable for mobile data on pre-paid plans. Users earn these AirTokens by opting to view advertisements in AirFox’s free Android apps. Users are rewarded in AirTokens for every ad impression on their device, which they then use for mobile data credit. \n19) Digital Asset Holdings \nHeaded up by a former JPMorgan executive, DAH develops and builds distributed ledger technology solutions for the financial services industry. Its software covers a variety of financial services, including loans, securities, derivatives, and foreign exchange. Its software maps business logic and legal processes to cryptographic signature flows and commits transactions to private or public distributed ledgers or traditional databases. \n20) Xapo \nThe Xapo mobile app is a Bitcoin and multi-currency wallet for smartphones that lets you pay for things with Bitcoin, which isn’t all that original. But you can send, receive, and convert funds between BitCoin and cash in all currencies worldwide, do bank transfers, and even use the Xapo Debit Card for in-store purchases, online, and at ATMs worldwide to use Bitcoins for every day purchases. \n21) Provenance \nProvenance is a real-time supply chain data platform that enables greater transparency by tracing the origins and histories of products. For example, each item has a unique digital token, enabling Provenance to verify every step of its production and create a digital history of the entire lifecycle of the product. \n22) Enigma \nNot the most original of names, Enigma is a peer-to-peer network, enabling different parties to jointly store and run computations on data while keeping the data private. This would allow companies to analyze consumer data without giving employees access to individual consumers’ personal information. Enigma's computational model is based on a highly optimized version of secure multi-party computation, guaranteed by a verifiable secret-sharing scheme. It uses blockchain to manage and secure the network so no third-party is needed. \n23) Colony \nColony is a decentralized autonomous organization that replicates a company, except it uses AI and crowdsourcing to make sure the right decisions are made by the right people. People can collaborate by joining projects, called colonies, and have a way to manage and measure productivity, as well as provide the means for people to get paid in tokens. \n24) Augur \nAugur is very ambitious. It offers a prediction market platform on real world events. You make your predictions by betting virtual shares on worldwide events, whether that’s the Oscars or geopolitics. It is built on Ethereum’s decentralized infrastructure and allows users can place custom bets and trade real money worldwide. All the money in the system will be in Bitcoin or other types of peer-to-peer cryptocurrency. \n25) Lisk \nLisk is a Blockchain application platform that enables users to build applications in JavaScript. The decentralized platform allows for the deployment, distribution and monetization of sidechains onto the Lisk Blockchain. Lisk users can code, deploy, and use applications in a simple, fast, and secure using Node.js. \n26) Parity Technologies \nAn offshoot of the Ethereum Project and lead by Ethereum’s co-founder Gavin Wood, Parity (formerly known as EthCore) develops software solutions for enterprises and industries to unlock the full value of decentralized technology. It’s attempting to solve some of the current issues facing the Ethereum blockchain such as privacy and scalability.",

      "text": "By Carla Mozee, MarketWatch\nTiffany, Staples earnings on deck; weekly jobless claims due\nU.S. stock futures edged higher Thursday, signaling a comeback from a rally-breaking prior session, on the starting day of the highly anticipated gathering of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyo.\nAhead of that symposium, fresh data on the U.S. labor market and a clutch of quarterly earnings from companies including Staples and Tiffany are scheduled for release.\nBut the highlight should be the central-bank summit, which has been on investors' minds this week, even though key speakers such as Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen won't appear until Friday.\n\"Markets are hoping for a change in sentiment that can take us off the recent risk-off mode,\" said Michala Marcussen, chief economist at Societe Generale, in a note.\n\"We are inclined to think that the Jackson Hole symposium will probably disappoint, with central bankers preferring to explain detailed actions in September,\" she said.\nFutures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 28 points, or 0.1%, to 21,823.00, while futures for the S&P 500 Index moved up 2.25 points, or 0.1%, to 2,443.75. Nasdaq-100 turned higher, rising 10.75 points, or 0.2%, to 5,858.75.\nThe indicated gains would mark a slight recovery, after the main indexes finished in the red Wednesday , undoing previous solid gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 index both fell 0.4%, while the Nasdaq Composite Index declined 0.3%.\nEquities' recent struggle has been put down in part to U.S. President Donald Trump's threat late Tuesday to shut down the government if he did not get funding for a border wall with Mexico.\nWords from Wyoming: The program for the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank's symposium,, title \"Fostering a Dynamic Global Economy,\" is set for release (https://www.kansascityfed.org/publications/research/escp) at 6 p.m. Mountain Time, or 8 p.m. Eastern Time. The meeting runs through Saturday.\nEuropean Central Bank President Mario Draghi will be on the lineup with Yellen on Friday, and investors will watch for any hints on the path for monetary policy from both central bank chiefs.\n\"[Yellen's] speech is of great importance, given the recent warnings from the Fed on vulnerabilities associated with asset valuations. Few disagree that the global easy monetary policies have created overstretched valuations,\" said Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM.\n\"Whether it's stocks, fixed income, real estate or bitcoins, there is a bubble somewhere,\" he wrote.\nEconomic docket: The Labor Department's report on weekly jobless claims, scheduled for release at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time, is expected to show a rise to 238,000.\nExisting home sales in July are expected to decline to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.50 million. The report from the National Association of Realtors is due at 10 a.m. Eastern.\nEarnings reports: Ahead of the bell, quarterly reports are due from Staples Inc. ( >> Staples, Inc. ) , and from jewelry retailers Tiffany & Co. ( >> Tiffany & Co. ) and Signet Jewelers Ltd. ( >> Signet Jewelers Ltd. ) . Food producers J.M. Smucker Co. ( >> J M Smucker Co ) and Hormel Foods Corp. ( >> Hormel Foods Corp ) are also set to report before trading gets under way.\nOther markets: Asian stock markets ended mixed, with Hong Kong shares higher and Japan's Nikkei losing ground. European equities were modestly higher .\nThe ICE Dollar Index was up 0.2% at 93.32. A single bitcoin was up 2.7% to $4.254.77.\nOil prices edged lower, while gold prices slipped 0.2% to $1,286.30 an ounce.\nStocks mentioned in the article : Staples, Inc. , Hormel Foods Corp , Tiffany & Co. , J M Smucker Co , Signet Jewelers Ltd.",

      "text": "Canada regulators say most crypto currency offerings need oversight Thursday, August 24, 2017 2:26 p.m. EDT FILE PHOTO: Bitcoin (virtual currency) coins are seen in an illustration picture taken at La Maison du Bitcoin in Paris, France, May 27, 201 \nBy Alastair Sharp \nTORONTO (Reuters) - Canadian securities regulators on Thursday said many Canadian crypto currency offerings they have studied involve the sale of securities and should abide by tough existing rules unless otherwise granted exemptions. \nCrypto currencies such as bitcoin and a growing stream of alternatives allow anonymous peer-to-peer transactions without the need for banks or central banks. They are also used by companies seeking to raise capital, in the form of initial coin offerings (ICOs) or initial token offerings (ITOs). \nThe currencies exist in a legal gray area, however, with regulators scrambling to come up with rules that will not stifle innovative funding models while also protecting investors. \nThe Canadian Securities Administers, an umbrella group of provincial watch-dogs, said any coin or token whose value is tied to the future profits or success of a business will likely be considered a security, while those providing access to a specific good, such as the ability to play a video game, may not. \n\"With the offerings that we have reviewed to date, we have in many instances found that the coins/tokens in question constitute securities for the purposes of securities laws, including because they are investment contracts,\" the regulators said in a statement. \n(http://www.osc.gov.on.ca/documents/en/Securities-Category4/csa_20170824_cryptocurrency-offerings.pdf) \nExecutives and advisers to the country's growing fintech industry criticized the statement for not offering enough clarity. \n\"There still is a lot of gray area in terms of the guidance on when a crypto currency or token would be a security,\" said Daniel Fuke, a partner in the securities and M&A group at Fasken Martineau who is advising companies, including CoinSquare, a crypto currency marketplace. \n\"It would be nice if we could know from CSA what they were thinking in terms of some of the sub-considerations of the securities law test.\" \nIn July, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said tokens issued through ICOs can be considered securities, meaning they would fall under disclosure laws and be subject to regulatory scrutiny unless a \"valid exemption\" applies. \nKik Interactive, a Waterloo, Ontario-based company launching a digital currency called Kin so its messaging customers can use a range of digital services, said it is working to ensure Kin is classified as a utility token, not a security. \nTo date, no business has issued a prospectus to complete an initial coin or token offering in Canada, nor has any crypto currency exchange been recognized or exempted from recognition in Canada, the regulators said. \n(Reporting by Alastair Sharp; Editing by Dan Grebler) More From Technology ",

      "title": "Goldman Sachs Granted Patent for SETLCoin Cryptocurrency",
      "text": "Goldman Sachs Granted Patent for SETLCoin Cryptocurrency Aug 24, 2017 Matthew Proffitt \n\nMany industries such as asset or investment fund management and banking are loaded with inefficiency due to their standing as a trusted third party. As a result, cryptocurrency and blockchain projects have emerged to help reduce these inefficiencies. Goldman Sachs has introduced their own blockchain-based settlement network for resolving transactions across many levels of business. \n\nBecause blockchains allow for instant or near-instant transaction resolution and confirmation, it is attractive for investors and bankers. The blockchain is secure and can be used to increase transparency, so it has garnered a large following in a relatively short period of time. Regulatory compliance requirements could change how the community responds to a given currency. \n\nCryptocurrencies have been on a slow decline over the last couple of weeks, with bitcoin resting around $2,300 and ETH stabilizing around the $200 mark, according to the WorldCoinIndex . Goldman Sachs is seeking to push forward with the acceptance of cryptocurrency use to secure and trade assets such as stock shares, land deeds, or precious metals. \nWhat is SETLCoin? \n\nSETLCoin is the digital framework that Goldman Sachs has designed to digitize real-world assets and improve transaction resolution times for asset trades. Cryptocurrencies like Ether are renowned for their quick resolution, and others like Bitcoin are widely-known for being immutable, or unable to be changed. \nHow does it work? \n\nSETLCoin relies on a trusted third-party to verify the existence of assets upon creation of SETLCoins. Such an entity may reasonably be the SEC, according to the patent, which can be viewed here . After the assets have been verified, a corresponding SETLCoin will be created and the SETLCoin token can be transferred on the blockchain. \n\nAssets need only be verified once in order to be able to transfer trustlessly across the network because they are secured by the network and have already been vouched for by globally reliable trustees. \n\nWhen sending assets, however, users must be careful of sending them to the right place, as with other blockchain networks, it is not likely that transactions can be changed or reversed. Immutability provides the needed insurance against fraudulent activity. \nWhat makes SETLCoin unique? \n\nSETLCoin is among the first of its kind, a cryptocurrency that will be implemented on a corporate scale for use in everyday business. By simplifying the processes associated with blockchain networks, Goldman Sachs may yet replace traditional business transaction and payment networks as far as asset transfer operations are concerned. \n\nComplimenting the novelty of SETLCoin is a patent , issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for a new “Cryptographic Currency For Securities Settlement.” The patent was initially made public in 2015 upon being published. \nHow are SETLCoins created? \n\nSETLCoins are made up asset verification by a trusted third party. After a third party has vouched for the asset initially, a ‘digital twin’ is created, and a trusted party is no longer required to facilitate asset transfers as the digital twin can be verified by the SETLCoin network. \n\nBoth wallets and distributed ledgers are vital components of SETLCoin and enable digital twin assets to cross borders more freely and in far less time than the traditional one-to-three business days. \nWhere will SETLCoins be stored? \nSETLCoins will be stored in a multi-asset blockchain wallet designed by Goldman Sachs. While the wallets will be used to store SETLCoins, they will also be used to facilitate coin transactions and peer-to-peer transaction on their blockchain network. \n\nThis multi-asset wallet was listed as a portion of the novel design in the patent application , which was filed in October of 2014. Paul Walker (Co-head, Bank Technology Div.) and Phil Venables (Chief Information Risk Officer) are listed as inventors on the patent. \n\nSETLCoins can be used to store both different securities and also different denominations of individual securities, such as LTC, BTC, ETH, and digitized company shares or even preferred shares and precious metals. Other assets that can be stored on SETLCoin include land deeds, vehicle titles, and virtually any proof of ownership. \nSummary \n\nSETLCoin is providing a base for investors to transfer their traditional assets (stocks, bonds, gold, silver, etc.) onto the blockchain and trade them more reliably, cheaper, and much faster than previously possible. The project was announced publicly by the USPTO in late 2015 and has continued to receive funding and technical focus since 2014 from one of the world’s largest investment banks. \n\nWhile the cryptocurrency community may have mixed feelings about the involvement of the SEC and other large regulatory bodies, only time will tell whether or not the change will have a positive impact on cryptocurrency as a whole. It will likely improve the standing of the banking industry as a whole, regardless.

The announcement caps a long-awaited list of updates on the “encrypted anonymous” content sharing platform, which Dotcom has built to incorporate Bitcoin payments . The ICO, Dotcom announced on Twitter Wednesday, will raise funds towards “building global infrastructure.” At the same time, a limited release of Bitcache will be available for testing by users “next week.” Next week you can register and try the first feature set of K.im and Bitcache. Then we're doing an #ICO to build our global infrastructure. — Kim Dotcom (@KimDotcom) August 23, 2017 Dotcom added that Twitter followers would be able to claim a “pre-loaded” Bitcache wallet with which they can purchase online content from the platform. You'll love this: ALL my twitter followers will get a >preloaded< Bitcache wallet to buy online content. Soon! We're friends, right? 👋🏻😎👍🏻 — Kim Dotcom (@KimDotcom) August 23, 2017 The Bitcache and newly-reborn Megaupload 2 products come while their illustrious creator continues to face legal pressures in the US and New Zealand. Last month, the US government released some of the over $42.5 mln capital and possessions previously frozen in Hong Kong, while the threat of extradition to the country still looms. The events surrounding the legal attention placed on Dotcom since 2012 have frequently made the mainstream press, and earlier this year a dedicated documentary hit the international market. \nHe has also announced a return to politics, saying his party would “take down” government restricting what citizens may view online, local news resource New Zealand Herald reported earlier this month.

      "title": "Bitcoin Tracker: Is Cryptocurrency The Next [Tech] Bubble?",
      "text": "Print \nReaching the peak interest among those in a particular industry just before it goes mainstream is something that’s happened on more than one occasion. Ranging from the housing bubble in the late 2000s to the dot-com bubble of the mid-’90s and the tech bubble of today, there have been myriad instances throughout history where being on the cusp of something new has greatly inflated the intrinsic value of the commodity itself. \nRising up over the last few decades, the latest to possibly join the bubble club has come in the form of cryptocurrencies. Stemming from eCommerce’s increasing popularity, the notion of paying without physical cash has become synonymous with online payments. As with any new way of doing something, there are bound to be those in that particular industry who seek to improve upon what some may call the beta version. \nIn a sense, digital currencies began via online payments, which have then shifted into the creation of cryptocurrency like bitcoin, Ethereum and dogecoin. \nOver the last year, cryptocurrency has been experiencing a heightened level of interest from multiple parties. From reported mainstream uses like Overstock’s announcement that it would accept all cryptocurrenciy, to bitcoin’s value teetering back and forth like a see-saw this year and even billionaire investor Mark Cuban taking off his bitcoin-skeptic glasses, the digital money arena seems to be gaining significant steam. \nWithin that lead up to the potential bubble, tax automation company Avalara’s CTO and EVP of engineering, Peter Horadan, shared with PYMNTS that it’s likely we are heading into one for the encrypted digital currency. While he says it’s unlikely the finance industry is heading into a cryptocurrency tech bubble, due to its seemingly unlimited supply, he says these specific types of digital currencies are a more pure expression of supply and demand. \n“The supply of a cryptocurrency is fixed in a very hard way. Cryptocurrencies are far more like a commodity (limited supply) than fiat currency (governments create more supply all the time), Horadan said. “It is certainly possible that speculators are hoarding cryptocurrencies and will later dump them and prices will drop. However, it seems entirely plausible that what we are seeing is simply that demand is rising sharply, as people realize just how much you can do with these new tools. With supply fixed, the demand-versus-supply ratio is changing very quickly.” \nThat demand for cryptocurrency is likely driven by the fact that, in terms of bitcoin, there is still some debate as to exactly how popular the digital currency is among top retailers. While some experts in the field may tout that there are anywhere between 50,000 merchants to 100,000 merchants accepting bitcoin, others share that out of the top 500 retailers , only three accept bitcoin, and people are writing about all the different types of bitcoin wallets available today. \nOne thing about cryptocurrency that may be certain for now is its inability to become the de facto currency around the world (at least for now). Horadan shared that we’re not likely to see these types of digital currencies push out traditional forms of finance interactions. “Managing currency is one of the strongest tools that governments have, and it is very hard to see governments being willing to give that up,” Horadan said. “For example, in the U.S., although there are many people who would argue that we should return to the gold standard we left in 1933, for eight decades now we have been unwilling to agree to that. Over the long term, it would make a lot of societal and government change for this idea to be considered.” \nAlthough it doesn’t appear that cryptocurrency will overtake currency as we know it now, it’s definitely not a passing fad and is something that should likely remain on the business room table. “Just the top five cryptocurrencies alone have a market cap of $115 billion,” said Horadan. “While that number is tiny in world economic scale (U.S. GDP is $19 trillion), it also is a statement that people in aggregate are willing to trust and invest in these systems with billions of dollars and real value.” \nToday, the approximate number of those with globally active cryptocurrency wallets is between 5.8 million to 11.5 million, according to the joint study conducted by the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Financing and University of Cambridge, Global Cryptocurrency Benchmarking Study . Whether or not the cryptocurrency bubble is upon us is something that we’ll likely be closely monitoring for the next five to 10 years.",

      "text": "\nSo I’ll let you just dive straight in. Enjoy and have a good weekend. When the money runs out \nA friend of mine recently reminded me of the phrase “polishing brass on the Titanic”. It’s a quote by Tyler Durden, Fight Club’s central villain. \nThe phrase is all about being in denial, busying ourselves with some task to forget about the whole that’s ultimately doomed. I thought about the quote again when I read this account of the ongoing chaos at Frisco News, a once hot media startup based in New York. \nIts founder tries desperately to maintain an air of normalcy as his business atrophies around him. It’s all fine, he tells his employees as the company misses yet another payroll. He does it not only to protect his ego but, as Gaby Del Valle points out here, in a desperate bid to procure more investment money. \nAnd Frisco News is just one part of an entire startup economy built on sand. Amid the B.S. and the bluster, the employees are left polishing brass on the Titanic. “It’s all going down, man.” Inside one of the world’s largest Bitcoin mines \nHere we can see the eerily joyless innards of the world’s crypto-currency boom. Situated somewhere in desolate inner Mongolia, this ‘mine’ (really a few warehouses filled with processors) is central to Bitcoin’s existence. \nSo ‘mining’ is the process of adding transaction records to Bitcoin's public ledger (known as the blockchain). It’s the sine qua non of Blockchain’s decentralised system because the blockchain is what maintains order. \nBut it’s also a weird relationship: inasmuch as mining is essential, the process is deliberately designed to be difficult and resource intensive. This is done to keep the miners’ output steady and consistent. There’s no rush, the blocks have to be churned out. \nI could carry on about the topic for many, many more words, but I’ll leave it to you to do some research yourself. The dark side of resilience \nToughen up! Grow a spine! There’s plenty of ways to tell people to be more resilient. In my first language of Afrikaans - a weird step-child of Dutch - boys are often told to “ byt vas”; literally: “Bite down and don’t let go”. \nResilience is good! John McClane was resilient; our heroes are resilient. But what are the limits of resiliency? Could too much resilience be a bad thing, “just like too much muscle mass”? \nWell, yeah: “As Rob Kaiser’s research on leadership versatility indicates, overused strengths become weaknesses. In line, it is easy to conceive of situations in which individuals could be too resilient for their own sake”. An overly resilient soul, for example, would double down on a lost cause out of a misguided belief in the idea of holding tight. \nThere are times where it’s not just okay to give up, but wise to do so. Recognising these times become difficult when you’re wearing the blindfold of resiliency. Game of Thrones: the best show on TV just became the silliest \nOkay, hands up: who gave the Game of Thrones characters (specifically Daenerys Targaryen and Jon Snow) a teleportation device? Trips that used to take whole seasons are now brief jaunts! \nLook, I’ve criticised GoT in the past for its at time glacial pacing and self-indulgent but ultimately unnecessary story arcs. But, my god, the answer to that critique wasn’t to tilt it to the other extreme. \nAs this cultural phenomenon nears its end, what was once a lumbering giant has become an addled, frenetic toddler rushing madly to its closing act. Somewhere in the middle would’ve been nice, guys. \nWho am I kidding, though. I’m clearly not going to stop watching. The Amazon effect echoes across the industry \nIn what way does Amazon warp our economies? Let me count the ways. \nBrick and mortar retail, content, and news, delivery, pharmaceuticals. All hail our overlord Monsieur Bezos. Forgive me for once thinking that our god-king would be less of a normie. \nBezos, a slight, balding, innocuous looking man helms this commercial Hydra. And he seems pretty chuffed with himself. I mean, he would be: he’ll probably be humanity’s first trillionaire. \nWe’re way past the point where we need to contemplate whether it’s a reality we’re comfortable with. In Sid Lumet’s classic Network, the central character Howard Beale is berated by the network chief Arthur Jensen for his rabble rousing. \nThe boss explains his “corporate cosmology”. “You get up on your little twenty-one-inch screen and howl about America and democracy,” says Jensen. “There is no America. There is no democracy. There is only IBM and ITT and AT&T and DuPont, Dow, Union Carbide, and Exxon. Those are the nations of the world today.” \nI think if we made Network today, Amazon would be on that list. We’d have a new Jensen berating a new Howard Beale, explaining this cosmology. “That is the natural order of things today,” says Jensen. “That is the atomic and subatomic and galactic structure of things today!” Tags ",

      "text": "By Carla Mozee, MarketWatch\nTiffany, Staples earnings on deck; weekly jobless claims due\nU.S. stock futures edged higher Thursday, signaling a comeback from a rally-breaking prior session, on the starting day of the highly anticipated gathering of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyo.\nAhead of that symposium, fresh data on the U.S. labor market and a clutch of quarterly earnings from companies including Staples and Tiffany are scheduled for release.\nBut the highlight should be the central-bank summit, which has been on investors' minds this week, even though key speakers such as Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen won't appear until Friday.\n\"Markets are hoping for a change in sentiment that can take us off the recent risk-off mode,\" said Michala Marcussen, chief economist at Societe Generale, in a note.\n\"We are inclined to think that the Jackson Hole symposium will probably disappoint, with central bankers preferring to explain detailed actions in September,\" she said.\nFutures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 28 points, or 0.1%, to 21,823.00, while futures for the S&P 500 Index moved up 2.25 points, or 0.1%, to 2,443.75. Nasdaq-100 turned higher, rising 10.75 points, or 0.2%, to 5,858.75.\nThe indicated gains would mark a slight recovery, after the main indexes finished in the red Wednesday (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/dow-rally-poised-to-peter-out-as-jackson-hole-comes-back-into-focus-2017-08-23), undoing previous solid gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 index both fell 0.4%, while the Nasdaq Composite Index declined 0.3%.\nEquities' recent struggle has been put down in part (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-shutdown-threat-rattles-stock-market-2017-08-23) to U.S. President Donald Trump's threat late Tuesday to shut down the government if he did not get funding for a border wall with Mexico.\nWords from Wyoming: The program for the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank's symposium,, title \"Fostering a Dynamic Global Economy,\" is set for release (https://www.kansascityfed.org/publications/research/escp) at 6 p.m. Mountain Time, or 8 p.m. Eastern Time. The meeting runs through Saturday.\nEuropean Central Bank President Mario Draghi will be on the lineup with Yellen on Friday, and investors will watch for any hints on the path for monetary policy from both central bank chiefs.\n\"[Yellen's] speech is of great importance, given the recent warnings from the Fed on vulnerabilities associated with asset valuations. Few disagree that the global easy monetary policies have created overstretched valuations,\" said Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM.\n\"Whether it's stocks, fixed income, real estate or bitcoins, there is a bubble somewhere,\" he wrote.\nSee:Here's what investors will be watching when Draghi, Yellen speak at Jackson Hole (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-what-investors-will-be-watching-when-draghi-yellen-speak-at-jackson-hole-2017-08-22)\nEconomic docket: The Labor Department's report on weekly jobless claims, scheduled for release at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time, is expected to show a rise to 238,000.\nExisting home sales in July are expected to decline to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.50 million. The report from the National Association of Realtors is due at 10 a.m. Eastern.\nEarnings reports: Ahead of the bell, quarterly reports are due from Staples Inc.(SPLS) , and from jewelry retailers Tiffany & Co.(TIF) and Signet Jewelers Ltd. (SIG) . Food producers J.M. Smucker Co. (SJM) and Hormel Foods Corp. (HRL) are also set to report before trading gets under way.\nOther markets: Asian stock markets ended mixed, with Hong Kong shares higher and Japan's Nikkei losing ground. European equities were modestly higher (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/european-stocks-post-cautious-gains-as-jackson-hole-day-arrives-2017-08-24).\nThe ICE Dollar Index was up 0.2% at 93.32. A single bitcoin was up 2.7% to $4.254.77.\nOil prices edged lower, while gold prices slipped 0.2% to $1,286.30 an ounce.\n 05:48 ET (09:48 GMT)\n ",

      "text": "By Anora Mahmudova, MarketWatch\nBitcoin Cash retreats\nBitcoin rose modestly on Thursday as the most prominent digital currency recovers from recent sharp declines that briefly put it into correction territory.\nMoves for the cyber monetary unit come as Securities and Exchange Commission temporarily suspended trading (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/sec-halts-trading-in-first-bitcoin-capital-after-it-gained-more-than-6000-in-2017-2017-08-24) in the shares of First Bitcoin Capital Corp. (BITCF) because of concerns about the accuracy and adequacy of public information on the Canadian company.\nStill, a single bitcoin rose 2.3% to $4,287.64, advancing for a third straight day, according to Coindesk.com data (https://www.coindesk.com/), and sending its total market value to about $70 billion, according to digital-currency research site Coinmarketcap.com (https://coinmarketcap.com/).\nDespite recent advances, the digital currency, is still about 5% below its record set on Aug. 17, though year to date, it is up more than 300%.\nBitcoin prices have been volatile, largely due to issues surrounding the need to increase transaction sizes in the blockchain network. Traditional bitcoin participants agreed on a new protocol known as Segregated Witness, or SegWit., which they believe solves bitcoin's scaling issue.\nThe adoption of SegWit hasn't been smooth, with a minority of users rejecting it, leading to the split of bitcoin that created Bitcoin Cash.\nOn Thursday, the price of Bitcoin Cash fell 1.6% to 649.32, bringing its market cap to $10.7 billion.\nEther tokens, the chief rival to bitcoin, which runs on the Ethereum network, was little changed on Thursday at $323.74. Ether on Wednesday rose 0.4% to $325, its highest level since June 23. While it remains below an all-time intraday high above $400 hit on June 12, it has more than doubled from a recent intraday low hit in mid-July. For 2017, it is up about 4,000%, bringing its market cap to $30.6 billion.\nRead: This bitcoin $25,000 call is more proof of the cybercurrency bubble (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/bitcoin-25000-this-is-more-proof-of-the-cybercurrency-bubble-2017-08-18)\nThe recent advances in bitcoin, along with the recovery in Ether, brought the total market capitalization of all cryprtocurrencies above $150 billion. The basket of cybercurrencies tracked by Coinmarketcap.com first broke above $100 billion in early June, meaning the space has risen by half in a little more than two months.\nMeanwhile, shares of Firtst Bitcoin Capital Corp traded at $1.79 before its halt. The stock traded at $0.05 at the start of the year and gained more than 6,000% year to date.\nFirst Bitcoin Capital Corp. is a Canadian corporation that invests in companies that mine bitcoin and operates exchanges and digital wallets, according to their website. The suspension was effective Thursday 9:30 Eastern Tim until noon Sept. 7.\nIn other news, A regulatory arm of Canada on Thursday signaled a warning about so-called initial coin offerings, or ICOs (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/ethereum-co-founder-warns-icos-are-a-ticking-time-bomb-2017-07-18), which have spiked in popularity. The Canadian Securities Administrator, although acknowledging the benefits of raising funds by digital tokens, it said there are big risks (https://www.inc.com/john-koetsier/ico-bubble-startups-are-raising-hundreds-of-millio.html).\n\"However, they can also raise investor protection concerns, due to issues around volatility, transparency, valuation, custody and liquidity, as well as the use of unregulated cryptocurrency exchanges.Also, investors may be harmed by unethical practices or illegal schemes, and may not understand the properties of the investment products that they are purchasing,\" the CSA said, adding that it was monitoring developments in ICOs (http://www.osc.gov.on.ca/documents/en/Securities-Category4/csa_20170824_cryptocurrency-offerings.pdf).\n(END) 24, 2017 11:36 ET (15:36 ",

      "text": "By Carla Mozee, MarketWatch\nTiffany, Staples earnings on deck; weekly jobless claims due\nU.S. stock futures edged higher Thursday, signaling a comeback from a rally-breaking prior session, on the starting day of the highly anticipated gathering of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyo.\nAhead of that symposium, fresh data on the U.S. labor market and a clutch of quarterly earnings from companies including Staples and Tiffany are scheduled for release.\nBut the highlight should be the central-bank summit, which has been on investors' minds this week, even though key speakers such as Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen won't appear until Friday.\n\"Markets are hoping for a change in sentiment that can take us off the recent risk-off mode,\" said Michala Marcussen, chief economist at Societe Generale, in a note.\n\"We are inclined to think that the Jackson Hole symposium will probably disappoint, with central bankers preferring to explain detailed actions in September,\" she said.\nFutures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 28 points, or 0.1%, to 21,823.00, while futures for the S&P 500 Index moved up 2.25 points, or 0.1%, to 2,443.75. Nasdaq-100 turned higher, rising 10.75 points, or 0.2%, to 5,858.75.\nThe indicated gains would mark a slight recovery, after the main indexes finished in the red Wednesday (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/dow-rally-poised-to-peter-out-as-jackson-hole-comes-back-into-focus-2017-08-23), undoing previous solid gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 index both fell 0.4%, while the Nasdaq Composite Index declined 0.3%.\nEquities' recent struggle has been put down in part (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-shutdown-threat-rattles-stock-market-2017-08-23) to U.S. President Donald Trump's threat late Tuesday to shut down the government if he did not get funding for a border wall with Mexico.\nWords from Wyoming: The program for the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank's symposium,, title \"Fostering a Dynamic Global Economy,\" is set for release (https://www.kansascityfed.org/publications/research/escp) at 6 p.m. Mountain Time, or 8 p.m. Eastern Time. The meeting runs through Saturday.\nEuropean Central Bank President Mario Draghi will be on the lineup with Yellen on Friday, and investors will watch for any hints on the path for monetary policy from both central bank chiefs.\n\"[Yellen's] speech is of great importance, given the recent warnings from the Fed on vulnerabilities associated with asset valuations. Few disagree that the global easy monetary policies have created overstretched valuations,\" said Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM.\n\"Whether it's stocks, fixed income, real estate or bitcoins, there is a bubble somewhere,\" he wrote.\nSee:Here's what investors will be watching when Draghi, Yellen speak at Jackson Hole (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-what-investors-will-be-watching-when-draghi-yellen-speak-at-jackson-hole-2017-08-22)\nEconomic docket: The Labor Department's report on weekly jobless claims, scheduled for release at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time, is expected to show a rise to 238,000.\nExisting home sales in July are expected to decline to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.50 million. The report from the National Association of Realtors is due at 10 a.m. Eastern.\nEarnings reports: Ahead of the bell, quarterly reports are due from Staples Inc.(SPLS) , and from jewelry retailers Tiffany & Co.(TIF) and Signet Jewelers Ltd. (SIG) . Food producers J.M. Smucker Co. (SJM) and Hormel Foods Corp. (HRL) are also set to report before trading gets under way.\nOther markets: Asian stock markets ended mixed, with Hong Kong shares higher and Japan's Nikkei losing ground. European equities were modestly higher (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/european-stocks-post-cautious-gains-as-jackson-hole-day-arrives-2017-08-24).\nThe ICE Dollar Index was up 0.2% at 93.32. A single bitcoin was up 2.7% to $4.254.77.\nOil prices edged lower, while gold prices slipped 0.2% to $1,286.30 an ounce.\n 24, 2017 05:48 ET (09:48 ",

      "text": "By Wallace Witkowski, MarketWatch , Ryan Vlastelica\nJobless claims rise less than expected in latest week\nU.S. stocks closed slightly lower Thursday, after a session of switching between small gains and losses, during a seasonally low-volume period prone to swings, as investors focused on a symposium of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyo.\nThe market had received a brief boost in afternoon trade after House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., expressed confidence in passing a tax-overhaul package this year and raising the debt ceiling.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 28.69 points, or 0.1%, at 21,783.40, with shares of Cisco Systems Inc.(CSCO) leading advancers and shares of Wal-Mart Stores Inc.(WMT) the largest decliner.\nThe S&P 500 declined 5.07 points, or 0.2%, to close at 2,438.97, with 10 out of the 11 primary S&P 500 sectors finishing lower, with consumer staples down 1.3% and industrials down 0.4%.\nThe Nasdaq Composite Index closed down 7.08 points, or 0.1%, at 6,271.33.\nDuring a CNBC interview a little after 1 p.m. Eastern, Ryan said Republicans are \"eye to eye\" with President Donald Trump regarding policy. The statement comes after the president late Tuesday threatened to close down the federal government if he wasn't able to secure the estimated $1.6 billion in funding from Congress to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico.\nWith stocks experiencing their lightest trading volumes of the year, the market is very easy to influence, said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist, at Prudential Financial, in an interview.\n\"Ryan wasn't just positive but he provided more details than we have had so far,\" Krosby said. \"In a pragmatic manner, he laid out what congress is able to do, and that was helpful. That's something the market has been looking for.\"\nStocks had their lightest volume day of the year on Wednesday (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-stocks-trade-at-lightest-volume-of-year-on-wednesday-2017-08-23), with about 5 billion shares traded, well below the year-to-date average of 6.54 billion. At the close, 2.76 billion shares had traded on the New York Stock Exchange and 1.52 billion had changed hands on the Nasdaq, both well below the already light average daily volumes for August.\nThe latest economic data also painted a mixed picture of economic conditions. Jobless claims rose by 2,000 in the latest week, a smaller increase than expected. Separately, a read on new-home sales came in at 571,000, below the 608,000 that had been expected, while mortgage rates fell to their lowest level of the year (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/mortgage-rates-plunge-to-2017-low-2017-08-24).\nThe meeting of central bankers is likely to be the primary driver of trading, even though such key speakers as Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen won't appear until Friday.\n\"You can't underestimate the importance of Jackson Hole, and this year is especially interesting,\" said Brian Battle, director of trading at Performance Trust Capital Partners. \"Yellen's commentary will be closely watched, because investors want to know both if the Fed will be raising rates, and also the timing and the magnitude of the Fed unwinding its portfolio.\"\nFor the week, the Dow is on pace to gain 0.5%, the S&P 500 is set to add 0.6%, while the Nasdaq Composite is on track to rise 0.9%, a move that would end a four-week string of declines for the technology-heavy index.\nWords from Wyoming: The program for the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank's symposium, titled \"Fostering a Dynamic Global Economy,\" is set for release (https://www.kansascityfed.org/publications/research/escp) at 8 p.m. Eastern Time. The meeting runs through Saturday.\nEuropean Central Bank President Mario Draghi will be on the lineup with Yellen on Friday, and investors will watch for any hints on the path for monetary policy from both central bank chiefs.\nOil prices (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/oil-prices-ease-with-caution-still-in-place-even-as-us-stockpiles-decline-2017-08-24) dropped 2% to settle at $47.43 a barrel as Hurricane Harvey (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-gulf-of-mexico-storm-harvey-is-bearish-for-oil-2017-08-24)bore down on the Gulf of Mexico, home to about 17% of U.S. crude production. Additionally, shares of Travelers Cos.(TRV) closed down 1.3%.\nSee:Here's what investors will be watching when Draghi, Yellen speak at Jackson Hole (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-what-investors-will-be-watching-when-draghi-yellen-speak-at-jackson-hole-2017-08-22)\nStock movers:Tiffany & Co.(TIF) posted second-quarter earnings of 92 cents a share (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/tiffany-co-shares-rise-after-earnings-revenue-beat-2017-08-24), beating expectations. Shares fell 1.3%.\nSignet shares (SIG) closed up nearly 17% after the jewelry retailer's quarterly earnings and sales beat expectations (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/signet-jewelers-shares-spike-after-earnings-beat-e-commerce-acquisition-2017-08-24).\nBurlington Stores(BURL) climbed 1.4% after the discount store chain posted better-than-expected second-quarter results (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/burlington-stores-stock-surges-8-premarket-on-better-than-expected-earnings-2017-08-24) and raised its outlook for the full year.\nSears Holdings Corp. (SHLD) posted a narrower quarterly loss of $2.34 a share (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/sears-loss-tops-views-to-close-28-kmart-stores-2017-08-24) and said it would close 28 Kmart stores this year. Shares fell 0.2%.\nJ.M. Smucker Co. shares(SJM) fell 9.5% as the foods producer lowered its full-year outlook and its first-quarter earnings missed estimates (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/jm-smucker-shares-fall-4-premarket-after-earnings-miss-2017-08-24). Hormel Foods Corp.'s(HRL) stock dropped 5.4% after the Spam maker cut its full-year earnings forecast.\nThe food companies were two of the biggest percentage decliners among S&P 500 components, and they pressured the consumer staples space.\nDollar Tree Inc.(DLTR) shares rallied 5.6% after the discount retailer reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/dollar-tree-shares-jump-9-premarket-on-better-than-expected-earnings-2017-08-24).\nPVH Corp. (PVH) shares rose 5.7% after the Calvin Klein parent topped Wall Street estimates for the quarter and raised its outlook (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/calvin-klein-parent-pvh-corp-shares-rise-on-earnings-beat-raised-guidance-2017-08-23).\nU.S.-listed shares of CRH PLC(CRG.DB) were up 3.7% after the Irish building materials company agreed to sell its Americas distribution business (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/crh-to-sell-us-distribution-unit-in-26b-deal-2017-08-24) to Beacon Roofing Supply(BECN).

      "text": "By Carla Mozee, MarketWatch\nTiffany, Staples earnings on deck; weekly jobless claims due\nU.S. stock futures edged higher Thursday, signaling a comeback from a rally-breaking prior session, on the starting day of the highly anticipated gathering of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyo.\nAhead of that symposium, fresh data on the U.S. labor market and a clutch of quarterly earnings from companies including Staples and Tiffany are scheduled for release.\nBut the highlight should be the central-bank summit, which has been on investors' minds this week, even though key speakers such as Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen won't appear until Friday.\n\"Markets are hoping for a change in sentiment that can take us off the recent risk-off mode,\" said Michala Marcussen, chief economist at Societe Generale, in a note.\n\"We are inclined to think that the Jackson Hole symposium will probably disappoint, with central bankers preferring to explain detailed actions in September,\" she said.\nFutures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 28 points, or 0.1%, to 21,823.00, while futures for the S&P 500 Index moved up 2.25 points, or 0.1%, to 2,443.75. Nasdaq-100 turned higher, rising 10.75 points, or 0.2%, to 5,858.75.\nThe indicated gains would mark a slight recovery, after the main indexes finished in the red Wednesday (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/dow-rally-poised-to-peter-out-as-jackson-hole-comes-back-into-focus-2017-08-23), undoing previous solid gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 index both fell 0.4%, while the Nasdaq Composite Index declined 0.3%.\nEquities' recent struggle has been put down in part (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-shutdown-threat-rattles-stock-market-2017-08-23) to U.S. President Donald Trump's threat late Tuesday to shut down the government if he did not get funding for a border wall with Mexico.\nWords from Wyoming: The program for the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank's symposium,, title \"Fostering a Dynamic Global Economy,\" is set for release (https://www.kansascityfed.org/publications/research/escp) at 6 p.m. Mountain Time, or 8 p.m. Eastern Time. The meeting runs through Saturday.\nEuropean Central Bank President Mario Draghi will be on the lineup with Yellen on Friday, and investors will watch for any hints on the path for monetary policy from both central bank chiefs.\n\"[Yellen's] speech is of great importance, given the recent warnings from the Fed on vulnerabilities associated with asset valuations. Few disagree that the global easy monetary policies have created overstretched valuations,\" said Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM.\n\"Whether it's stocks, fixed income, real estate or bitcoins, there is a bubble somewhere,\" he wrote.\nSee:Here's what investors will be watching when Draghi, Yellen speak at Jackson Hole (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-what-investors-will-be-watching-when-draghi-yellen-speak-at-jackson-hole-2017-08-22)\nEconomic docket: The Labor Department's report on weekly jobless claims, scheduled for release at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time, is expected to show a rise to 238,000.\nExisting home sales in July are expected to decline to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.50 million. The report from the National Association of Realtors is due at 10 a.m. Eastern.\nEarnings reports: Ahead of the bell, quarterly reports are due from Staples Inc.(SPLS) , and from jewelry retailers Tiffany & Co.(TIF) and Signet Jewelers Ltd. (SIG) . Food producers J.M. Smucker Co. (SJM) and Hormel Foods Corp. (HRL) are also set to report before trading gets under way.\nOther markets: Asian stock markets ended mixed, with Hong Kong shares higher and Japan's Nikkei losing ground. European equities were modestly higher (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/european-stocks-post-cautious-gains-as-jackson-hole-day-arrives-2017-08-24).\nThe ICE Dollar Index was up 0.2% at 93.32.

      "title": "Blockchain: 4 ways to experiment",
      "text": "on August 24, 2017 Why are a growing number of enterprises diving into blockchain technology? Blockchain is open-source technology used to create a distributed ledger – a shared record of transactions (financial or otherwise). The basic idea: No one can tamper with it because everyone has access to the same information and to an unalterable record of any changes made. Blockchain is best known as the technology that powers cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether, but it can do much more than that. “Any instance where data needs to be transferred among parties who don’t necessarily trust each other could benefit from a distributed database,” says Matt Chwierut, research director at Smith + Crown , a research group that focuses on blockchain technology. “The Internet of Things is a good example. Any given IoT company might want every other machine network to send information on their protocol, but they don’t necessarily trust each other’s protocols. You can’t get everyone on one company’s protocol, but you might be able to use a distributed database where no one party had control.” [ Blockchain could simplify internal workflow as well as external transactions with customers and partners. See our related article, Blockchain: 3 big implications for your company . ] Some blockchains can be used to create “smart contracts,” which rethink the typical contract process by executing automatically once certain conditions are met. Such contracts hold promise in fields such as banking and pharmaceuticals. However, more technology advances are needed before those contracts can communicate with other corporate data systems (see American Banker's recent article, \" The race to connect smart contracts to the real world .\") In another example, blockchain could offer a new way for artists and musicians to reap more of the rewards from their work. If you’re ready to explore using blockchain and blockchain applications, consider these four basic ways that companies can experiment, as Chwierut describes them: 1. Use blockchain-as-a-service Some cloud providers, such as Microsoft Azure and AWS, offer blockchain-as-a-service, essentially providing a sandbox in which you can begin building blockchain applications to see how they might work for your company. Pros: It’s a very limited commitment, allowing you to take blockchain for a test drive. Cons: Blockchain-as-a-service is most useful for experimentation, so if you decide to get serious about blockchain you will likely need to move on from this approach. 2. Use a public blockchain platform People tend to think of Ethereum, bitcoin, and others as currencies, but they are also publicly available platforms that companies can use to host transactions and applications. Pros: Since these platforms are open to anyone, anyone can interact with your blockchain application without you needing to open your own network to outside parties. These are well-established, competitive networks. (For more, see this CNBC article on recent rivalry between the Ethereum and bitcoin platforms. ) Cons: Because transactions run on a distributed platform – i.e., on the servers of currency “miners” who agree to host them – there’s a small cost associated with each transaction. 3. Fork an open-source blockchain and use on your own servers This means grabbing the open source code from a blockchain project and tweaking it to make your own blockchain. This option is popular with companies that want to use blockchain for things like authentication and collaboration internally. It can also be used for internal experimentation. Pros: You can modify the blockchain to your liking. And you can keep it within your network and limit access as you see fit. Cons: The blockchain may not work precisely the way you want it to. 4. Write a blockchain protocol from scratch Since the software developer community has already done so much work on blockchain, you likely wouldn’t choose to write a blockchain from scratch. But if you have a compelling reason to do so, it is an option. \nRelated content Blockchain: 3 big implications for your company Pros: You can design the blockchain the way you want. For instance, you may choose to process transactions faster than existing public blockchains do, or you may want to change the size of the blocks with which you work. Cons: Public blockchains benefit from the ongoing work of the open-source community, which is constantly debugging them. If you create your own blockchain, you’ll need to troubleshoot it yourself. Also, you will miss out on the brainpower of the community as you strive to improve. Related content",

      "text": "By Carla Mozee, MarketWatch\nTiffany, Staples earnings on deck; weekly jobless claims due\nU.S. stock futures edged higher Thursday, signaling a comeback from a rally-breaking prior session, on the starting day of the highly anticipated gathering of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyo.\nAhead of that symposium, fresh data on the U.S. labor market and a clutch of quarterly earnings from companies including Staples and Tiffany are scheduled for release.\nBut the highlight should be the central-bank summit, which has been on investors' minds this week, even though key speakers such as Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen won't appear until Friday.\n\"Markets are hoping for a change in sentiment that can take us off the recent risk-off mode,\" said Michala Marcussen, chief economist at Societe Generale, in a note.\n\"We are inclined to think that the Jackson Hole symposium will probably disappoint, with central bankers preferring to explain detailed actions in September,\" she said.\nFutures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 28 points, or 0.1%, to 21,823.00, while futures for the S&P 500 Index moved up 2.25 points, or 0.1%, to 2,443.75. Nasdaq-100 turned higher, rising 10.75 points, or 0.2%, to 5,858.75.\nThe indicated gains would mark a slight recovery, after the main indexes finished in the red Wednesday (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/dow-rally-poised-to-peter-out-as-jackson-hole-comes-back-into-focus-2017-08-23), undoing previous solid gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 index both fell 0.4%, while the Nasdaq Composite Index declined 0.3%.\nEquities' recent struggle has been put down in part (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-shutdown-threat-rattles-stock-market-2017-08-23) to U.S. President Donald Trump's threat late Tuesday to shut down the government if he did not get funding for a border wall with Mexico.\nWords from Wyoming: The program for the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank's symposium,, title \"Fostering a Dynamic Global Economy,\" is set for release (https://www.kansascityfed.org/publications/research/escp) at 6 p.m. Mountain Time, or 8 p.m. Eastern Time. The meeting runs through Saturday.\nEuropean Central Bank President Mario Draghi will be on the lineup with Yellen on Friday, and investors will watch for any hints on the path for monetary policy from both central bank chiefs.\n\"[Yellen's] speech is of great importance, given the recent warnings from the Fed on vulnerabilities associated with asset valuations. Few disagree that the global easy monetary policies have created overstretched valuations,\" said Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM.\n\"Whether it's stocks, fixed income, real estate or bitcoins, there is a bubble somewhere,\" he wrote.\nSee:Here's what investors will be watching when Draghi, Yellen speak at Jackson Hole (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-what-investors-will-be-watching-when-draghi-yellen-speak-at-jackson-hole-2017-08-22)\nEconomic docket: The Labor Department's report on weekly jobless claims, scheduled for release at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time, is expected to show a rise to 238,000.\nExisting home sales in July are expected to decline to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.50 million. The report from the National Association of Realtors is due at 10 a.m. Eastern.\nEarnings reports: Ahead of the bell, quarterly reports are due from Staples Inc.(SPLS) , and from jewelry retailers Tiffany & Co.(TIF) and Signet Jewelers Ltd. (SIG) . Food producers J.M. Smucker Co. (SJM) and Hormel Foods Corp. (HRL) are also set to report before trading gets under way.\nOther markets: Asian stock markets ended mixed, with Hong Kong shares higher and Japan's Nikkei losing ground. European equities were modestly higher (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/european-stocks-post-cautious-gains-as-jackson-hole-day-arrives-2017-08-24).\nThe ICE Dollar Index was up 0.2% at 93.32. A single bitcoin was up 2.7% to $4.254.77.\nOil prices edged lower, while gold prices slipped 0.2% to $1,286.30 an ounce.\n 24, 2017 05:48 ET (09:48 ",

      "text": "By Wallace Witkowski, MarketWatch , Ryan Vlastelica\nJobless claims rise less than expected in latest week\nU.S. stocks closed slightly lower Thursday, after a session of switching between small gains and losses, during a seasonally low-volume period prone to swings, as investors focused on a symposium of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyo.\nThe market had received a brief boost in afternoon trade after House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., expressed confidence in passing a tax-overhaul package this year and raising the debt ceiling.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 28.69 points, or 0.1%, at 21,783.40, with shares of Cisco Systems Inc.(CSCO) leading advancers and shares of Wal-Mart Stores Inc.(WMT) the largest decliner.\nThe S&P 500 declined 5.07 points, or 0.2%, to close at 2,438.97, with 10 out of the 11 primary S&P 500 sectors finishing lower, with consumer staples down 1.3% and industrials down 0.4%.\nThe Nasdaq Composite Index closed down 7.08 points, or 0.1%, at 6,271.33.\nDuring a CNBC interview a little after 1 p.m. Eastern, Ryan said Republicans are \"eye to eye\" with President Donald Trump regarding policy. The statement comes after the president late Tuesday threatened to close down the federal government if he wasn't able to secure the estimated $1.6 billion in funding from Congress to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico.\nWith stocks experiencing their lightest trading volumes of the year, the market is very easy to influence, said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist, at Prudential Financial, in an interview.\n\"Ryan wasn't just positive but he provided more details than we have had so far,\" Krosby said. \"In a pragmatic manner, he laid out what congress is able to do, and that was helpful. That's something the market has been looking for.\"\nStocks had their lightest volume day of the year on Wednesday (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-stocks-trade-at-lightest-volume-of-year-on-wednesday-2017-08-23), with about 5 billion shares traded, well below the year-to-date average of 6.54 billion. At the close, 2.76 billion shares had traded on the New York Stock Exchange and 1.52 billion had changed hands on the Nasdaq, both well below the already light average daily volumes for August.\nThe latest economic data also painted a mixed picture of economic conditions. Jobless claims rose by 2,000 in the latest week, a smaller increase than expected. Separately, a read on new-home sales came in at 571,000, below the 608,000 that had been expected, while mortgage rates fell to their lowest level of the year (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/mortgage-rates-plunge-to-2017-low-2017-08-24).\nThe meeting of central bankers is likely to be the primary driver of trading, even though such key speakers as Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen won't appear until Friday.\n\"You can't underestimate the importance of Jackson Hole, and this year is especially interesting,\" said Brian Battle, director of trading at Performance Trust Capital Partners. \"Yellen's commentary will be closely watched, because investors want to know both if the Fed will be raising rates, and also the timing and the magnitude of the Fed unwinding its portfolio.\"\nFor the week, the Dow is on pace to gain 0.5%, the S&P 500 is set to add 0.6%, while the Nasdaq Composite is on track to rise 0.9%, a move that would end a four-week string of declines for the technology-heavy index.\nWords from Wyoming: The program for the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank's symposium, titled \"Fostering a Dynamic Global Economy,\" is set for release (https://www.kansascityfed.org/publications/research/escp) at 8 p.m. Eastern Time. The meeting runs through Saturday.\nEuropean Central Bank President Mario Draghi will be on the lineup with Yellen on Friday, and investors will watch for any hints on the path for monetary policy from both central bank chiefs.\nOil prices (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/oil-prices-ease-with-caution-still-in-place-even-as-us-stockpiles-decline-2017-08-24) dropped 2% to settle at $47.43 a barrel as Hurricane Harvey (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-gulf-of-mexico-storm-harvey-is-bearish-for-oil-2017-08-24)bore down on the Gulf of Mexico, home to about 17% of U.S. crude production. Additionally, shares of Travelers Cos.(TRV) closed down 1.3%.\nSee:Here's what investors will be watching when Draghi, Yellen speak at Jackson Hole (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-what-investors-will-be-watching-when-draghi-yellen-speak-at-jackson-hole-2017-08-22)\nStock movers:Tiffany & Co.(TIF) posted second-quarter earnings of 92 cents a share (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/tiffany-co-shares-rise-after-earnings-revenue-beat-2017-08-24), beating expectations.

(SHLD) posted a narrower quarterly loss of $2.34 a share (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/sears-loss-tops-views-to-close-28-kmart-stores-2017-08-24) and said it would close 28 Kmart stores this year. Shares fell 0.2%.\nJ.M. Smucker Co. shares(SJM) fell 9.5% as the foods producer lowered its full-year outlook and its first-quarter earnings missed estimates (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/jm-smucker-shares-fall-4-premarket-after-earnings-miss-2017-08-24). Hormel Foods Corp.'s(HRL) stock dropped 5.4% after the Spam maker cut its full-year earnings forecast.\nThe food companies were two of the biggest percentage decliners among S&P 500 components, and they pressured the consumer staples space.\nDollar Tree Inc.(DLTR) shares rallied 5.6% after the discount retailer reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/dollar-tree-shares-jump-9-premarket-on-better-than-expected-earnings-2017-08-24).\nPVH Corp. (PVH) shares rose 5.7% after the Calvin Klein parent topped Wall Street estimates for the quarter and raised its outlook (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/calvin-klein-parent-pvh-corp-shares-rise-on-earnings-beat-raised-guidance-2017-08-23).\nU.S.-listed shares of CRH PLC(CRG.DB) were up 3.7% after the Irish building materials company agreed to sell its Americas distribution business (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/crh-to-sell-us-distribution-unit-in-26b-deal-2017-08-24) to Beacon Roofing Supply(BECN). Beacon shares climbed 9.8%.\nA consortium that includes Western Digital Corp.(WDC) will offer 1.9 trillion yen ($17 billion) to purchase Toshiba Corp.'s(6502.TO) memory chip business, sources told Reuters on Thursday. (https://finance.yahoo.com/news/western-digital-group-offer-1-091619106.html)\n(https://finance.yahoo.com/news/western-digital-group-offer-1-091619106.html)Invesco Ltd. is reportedly closing in on a $1 billion deal (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/invesco-closes-in-on-1-billion-deal-to-buy-guggenheims-etf-business-2017-08-24) for Guggenheim Partners's ETF business.

      "text": "By Carla Mozee, MarketWatch\nRetailers' shares active after earnings releases; weekly jobless claims due\nU.S. stock futures edged modestly higher Thursday, signaling a comeback from the prior session, on the opening day of the highly anticipated gathering of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyo.\nShares in retailers, including Signet Jewelers Ltd. (SIG) and Burlington Stores Inc. (BURL), were rising after posting quarterly earnings, while Sears Holdings Corp.(SHLD) said it would close another 28 Kmart stores.\nFutures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 46 points, or 0.2%, to 21,839.00, while futures for the S&P 500 index moved up 4.25 points, or 0.2%, to 2,445.75. Nasdaq-100 added 15.50 points, or 0.3%, to 5,863.25.\nAn update on the jobs market is due, but the highlight should be the central-bank summit. The meeting has been on investors' minds this week, even though key speakers such as Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen won't appear until Friday.\n\"Markets are hoping for a change in sentiment that can take us off the recent risk-off mode,\" said Michala Marcussen, chief economist at Société Générale, in a note.\n\"We are inclined to think that the Jackson Hole symposium will probably disappoint, with central bankers preferring to explain detailed actions in September,\" she said.\nThe indicated gains would mark a slight recovery, after the main indexes finished in the red Wednesday (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/dow-rally-poised-to-peter-out-as-jackson-hole-comes-back-into-focus-2017-08-23), undoing previous solid gains.

The meeting runs through Saturday.\n will be on the lineup with Yellen on Friday, and investors will watch for any hints on the path for monetary policy from both central bank chiefs.\n\"[Yellen's] speech is of great importance, given the recent warnings from the Fed on vulnerabilities associated with asset valuations. Few disagree that the global easy monetary policies have created overstretched valuations,\" said Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM.\nSee:Here's what investors will be watching when Draghi, Yellen speak at Jackson Hole (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-what-investors-will-be-watching-when-draghi-yellen-speak-at-jackson-hole-2017-08-22)\nStock movers:Tiffany & Co.(TIF) posted second-quarter earnings of 92 cents a share (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/tiffany-co-shares-rise-after-earnings-revenue-beat-2017-08-24), beating expectations.

Shares were inactive in premarket trading.\nU.S.-listed shares of CRH PLC(CRG.DB) were up 3.8% premarket after the Irish building materials company agreed to sell its Americas distribution business (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/crh-to-sell-us-distribution-unit-in-26b-deal-2017-08-24) to Beacon Roofing Supply(BECN).\nA consortium that includes Western Digital Corp.(WDC) will offer 1.9 trillion yen ($17 billion) to purchase Toshiba Corp.'s(6502.TO) memory chip business, sources told Reuters on Thursday.

      "text": "By Carla Mozee, MarketWatch , Ryan Vlastelica\nJobless claims rise less than expected in latest week\nU.S. stocks fell on Thursday, erasing an early advance and extending the previous session's decline as traders awaited the highly anticipated gathering of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyo., before making big bets on market direction.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 19 points to 21,792, a decline of 0.1%. The S&P 500 slid 3 points, or 0.1%, to 2,441. The Nasdaq Composite Index lost 8 points, or 0.1%, to 6,270.\nThe day's losses were broad-based, with nine of the 11 primary S&P 500 sectors down on the day. Consumer staples were the biggest losers, off 0.5%, with energy down 0.3%.\nMarket participants also digested the latest economic data, which showed that jobless claims rose by 2,000 in the latest week, a smaller increase than expected. Separately, a read on new-home sales came in at 571,000, below the 608,000 that had been expected, while mortgage rates fell to their lowest level of the year (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/mortgage-rates-plunge-to-2017-low-2017-08-24).\nThe meeting of central bankers is likely to be the primary driver of trading, even though such key speakers as Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen won't appear until Friday.\n\"You can't underestimate the importance of Jackson Hole, and this year is especially interesting,\" said Brian Battle, director of trading at Performance Trust Capital Partners. \"Yellen's commentary will be closely watched, because investors want to know both if the Fed will be raising rates, and also the timing and the magnitude of the Fed unwinding its portfolio.\"\nFor the week, the Dow is on pace to gain 0.5%, the S&P 500 is set to add 0.6%, while the Nasdaq Composite is on track to rise 0.8%, a move that would end a four-week string of declines for the technology-heavy index.\nEquities' recent struggle has in part been put down (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-shutdown-threat-rattles-stock-market-2017-08-23) to President Donald Trump's threat late Tuesday to shut down the government if he didn't get funding for a border wall with Mexico.\n\"The headlines out of D.C. are looming over the stock market,\" Battle said. \"Is there going to be a shutdown? A fight over the debt ceiling? We've heard these threats before, but they seem pretty contentious this time. Plus there is the question about tax reform. If that doesn't get done, that'll take some of the air out of the market.\"\nWords from Wyoming: The program for the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank's symposium, titled \"Fostering a Dynamic Global Economy,\" is set for release (https://www.kansascityfed.org/publications/research/escp) at 8 p.m. Eastern Time. The meeting runs through Saturday.\n will be on the lineup with Yellen on Friday, and investors will watch for any hints on the path for monetary policy from both central bank chiefs.\nSee:Here's what investors will be watching when Draghi, Yellen speak at Jackson Hole (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-what-investors-will-be-watching-when-draghi-yellen-speak-at-jackson-hole-2017-08-22)\nStock movers:Tiffany & Co.(TIF) posted second-quarter earnings of 92 cents a share (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/tiffany-co-shares-rise-after-earnings-revenue-beat-2017-08-24), beating expectations.

Shares spiked 7.8%.\nJ.M. Smucker Co. shares(SJM) fell 7.7% as the foods producer lowered its full-year outlook and its first-quarter earnings missed estimates (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/jm-smucker-shares-fall-4-premarket-after-earnings-miss-2017-08-24). Hormel Foods Corp.'s(HRL) stock dropped 7.1% after the Spam maker cut its full-year earnings forecast.\nThe food companies were the two biggest percentage decliners among S&P 500 components, and they pressured the consumer staples space.\nU.S.-listed shares of CRH PLC(CRG.DB) were up 3.6% after the Irish building materials company agreed to sell its Americas distribution business (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/crh-to-sell-us-distribution-unit-in-26b-deal-2017-08-24) to Beacon Roofing Supply(BECN). Beacon shares climbed 14%.\nA consortium that includes Western Digital Corp.(WDC) will offer 1.9 trillion yen ($17 billion) to purchase Toshiba Corp.'s(6502.TO) memory chip business, sources told Reuters on Thursday. (https://finance.yahoo.com/news/western-digital-group-offer-1-091619106.html)\n(https://finance.yahoo.com/news/western-digital-group-offer-1-091619106.html)Invesco Ltd. is reportedly closing in on a $1 billion deal (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/invesco-closes-in-on-1-billion-deal-to-buy-guggenheims-etf-business-2017-08-24) for Guggenheim Partners's ETF business.

      "text": "By Carla Mozee, MarketWatch , Ryan Vlastelica\nJobless claims rise less than expected in latest week\nU.S. stock futures pointed to a modestly higher open Thursday, signaling a comeback from the prior session, as investors looked ahead to the start of the highly anticipated gathering of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyo.\nFutures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 63 points, or 0.3%, to 21,860, while futures for the S&P 500 index moved up 6.75 points, or 0.3%, to 2,448. Nasdaq-100 added 22 points, or 0.4%, to 5,869.75.\nMarket participants also digested the latest economic data, which showed that jobless claims rose by 2,000 in the latest week. However, the labor market remains strong. Claims are coming off a six-month low and the increase in the latest week was below forecasts.\nDespite that, the meeting of central bankers is likely to be the primary driver of trading, even though key speakers such as Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen won't appear until Friday.\n\"Markets are hoping for a change in sentiment that can take us off the recent risk-off mode,\" said Michala Marcussen, chief economist at Société Générale, in a note.\n\"We are inclined to think that the Jackson Hole symposium will probably disappoint, with central bankers preferring to explain detailed actions in September,\" she said.\nThe indicated gains would mark a slight recovery, after the main indexes finished in the red Wednesday (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/dow-rally-poised-to-peter-out-as-jackson-hole-comes-back-into-focus-2017-08-23), undoing previous solid gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 index both fell 0.4%, while the Nasdaq Composite Index declined 0.3%.\nFor the week, the Dow is on pace to gain 0.6%, the S&P 500 is set to add 0.8%, while the Nasdaq Composite is on track to rise 1%, a move that would end a four-week string of declines for the technology-heavy index.\nEquities' recent struggle has been put down in part (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-shutdown-threat-rattles-stock-market-2017-08-23) to President Donald Trump's threat late Tuesday to shut down the government if he didn't get funding for a border wall with Mexico.\nWords from Wyoming: The program for the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank's symposium, titled \"Fostering a Dynamic Global Economy,\" is set for release (https://www.kansascityfed.org/publications/research/escp) at 6 p.m. Mountain time, or 8 p.m. Eastern Time. The meeting runs through Saturday.\n will be on the lineup with Yellen on Friday, and investors will watch for any hints on the path for monetary policy from both central bank chiefs.\n\"[Yellen's] speech is of great importance, given the recent warnings from the Fed on vulnerabilities associated with asset valuations. Few disagree that the global easy monetary policies have created overstretched valuations,\" said Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM.\nSee:Here's what investors will be watching when Draghi, Yellen speak at Jackson Hole (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-what-investors-will-be-watching-when-draghi-yellen-speak-at-jackson-hole-2017-08-22)\nStock movers:Tiffany & Co.(TIF) posted second-quarter earnings of 92 cents a share (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/tiffany-co-shares-rise-after-earnings-revenue-beat-2017-08-24), beating expectations.

Smucker Co. shares(SJM)fell 4.7% premarket (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/jm-smucker-shares-fall-4-premarket-after-earnings-miss-2017-08-24) as the foods producer lowered its full-year outlook and its first-quarter earnings missed estimates.\nHormel Foods Corp.'s(HRL) stock dropped 4.5% premarket after the Spam maker cut its full-year earnings forecast.\nSears(SHLD) posted a narrower quarterly loss of $2.34 a share (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/sears-loss-tops-views-to-close-28-kmart-stores-2017-08-24) and said it would close 28 Kmart stores this year. Shares were inactive in premarket trading.\nU.S.-listed shares of CRH PLC(CRG.DB) were up 3.8% premarket after the Irish building materials company agreed to sell its Americas distribution business (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/crh-to-sell-us-distribution-unit-in-26b-deal-2017-08-24) to Beacon Roofing Supply(BECN).\nA consortium that includes Western Digital Corp.(WDC) will offer 1.9 trillion yen ($17 billion) to purchase Toshiba Corp.'s(6502.TO) memory chip business, sources told Reuters on Thursday. (https://finance.yahoo.com/news/western-digital-group-offer-1-091619106.html)\n(https://finance.yahoo.com/news/western-digital-group-offer-1-091619106.html)Invesco Ltd. is reportedly closing in on a $1 billion deal (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/invesco-closes-in-on-1-billion-deal-to-buy-guggenheims-etf-business-2017-08-24) for Guggenheim Partners's ETF business.\nEconomic docket: The Labor Department's report on weekly jobless claims, scheduled for release at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time, is expected to show a rise to 238,000.\nExisting home sales in July are expected to decline to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.50 million.

      "title": "MARKET SNAPSHOT: Stock Market Closes Slightly Lower In Volatile Session",
      "text": "By Wallace Witkowski, MarketWatch , Ryan Vlastelica\nJobless claims rise less than expected in latest week\nU.S. stocks closed slightly lower Thursday, after a session of switching between small gains and losses, during a seasonally low-volume period prone to swings, as investors focused on a symposium of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyo.\nThe market had received a brief boost in afternoon trade after House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., expressed confidence in passing a tax-overhaul package this year and raising the debt ceiling.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 28.69 points, or 0.1%, at 21,783.40, with shares of Cisco Systems Inc.(CSCO) leading advancers and shares of Wal-Mart Stores Inc.(WMT) the largest decliner.\nThe S&P 500 declined 5.07 points, or 0.2%, to close at 2,438.97, with 10 out of the 11 primary S&P 500 sectors finishing lower, with consumer staples down 1.3% and industrials down 0.4%.\nThe Nasdaq Composite Index closed down 7.08 points, or 0.1%, at 6,271.33.\nDuring a CNBC interview a little after 1 p.m. Eastern, Ryan said Republicans are \"eye to eye\" with President Donald Trump regarding policy. The statement comes after the president late Tuesday threatened to close down the federal government if he wasn't able to secure the estimated $1.6 billion in funding from Congress to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico.\nWith stocks experiencing their lightest trading volumes of the year, the market is very easy to influence, said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist, at Prudential Financial, in an interview.\n\"Ryan wasn't just positive but he provided more details than we have had so far,\" Krosby said. \"In a pragmatic manner, he laid out what congress is able to do, and that was helpful. That's something the market has been looking for.\"\nStocks had their lightest volume day of the year on Wednesday (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-stocks-trade-at-lightest-volume-of-year-on-wednesday-2017-08-23), with about 5 billion shares traded, well below the year-to-date average of 6.54 billion. At the close, 2.76 billion shares had traded on the New York Stock Exchange and 1.52 billion had changed hands on the Nasdaq, both well below the already light average daily volumes for August.\nThe latest economic data also painted a mixed picture of economic conditions. Jobless claims rose by 2,000 in the latest week, a smaller increase than expected. Separately, a read on new-home sales came in at 571,000, below the 608,000 that had been expected, while mortgage rates fell to their lowest level of the year (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/mortgage-rates-plunge-to-2017-low-2017-08-24).\nThe meeting of central bankers is likely to be the primary driver of trading, even though such key speakers as Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen won't appear until Friday.\n\"You can't underestimate the importance of Jackson Hole, and this year is especially interesting,\" said Brian Battle, director of trading at Performance Trust Capital Partners. \"Yellen's commentary will be closely watched, because investors want to know both if the Fed will be raising rates, and also the timing and the magnitude of the Fed unwinding its portfolio.\"\nFor the week, the Dow is on pace to gain 0.5%, the S&P 500 is set to add 0.6%, while the Nasdaq Composite is on track to rise 0.9%, a move that would end a four-week string of declines for the technology-heavy index.\nWords from Wyoming: The program for the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank's symposium, titled \"Fostering a Dynamic Global Economy,\" is set for release (https://www.kansascityfed.org/publications/research/escp) at 8 p.m. Eastern Time. The meeting runs through Saturday.\nEuropean Central Bank President Mario Draghi will be on the lineup with Yellen on Friday, and investors will watch for any hints on the path for monetary policy from both central bank chiefs.\nOil prices (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/oil-prices-ease-with-caution-still-in-place-even-as-us-stockpiles-decline-2017-08-24) dropped 2% to settle at $47.43 a barrel as Hurricane Harvey (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-gulf-of-mexico-storm-harvey-is-bearish-for-oil-2017-08-24)bore down on the Gulf of Mexico, home to about 17% of U.S. crude production. Additionally, shares of Travelers Cos.(TRV) closed down 1.3%.\nSee:Here's what investors will be watching when Draghi, Yellen speak at Jackson Hole (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-what-investors-will-be-watching-when-draghi-yellen-speak-at-jackson-hole-2017-08-22)\nStock movers:Tiffany & Co.(TIF) posted second-quarter earnings of 92 cents a share (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/tiffany-co-shares-rise-after-earnings-revenue-beat-2017-08-24), beating expectations.

Shares fell 0.2%.\nJ.M. Smucker Co. shares(SJM) fell 9.5% as the foods producer lowered its full-year outlook and its first-quarter earnings missed estimates (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/jm-smucker-shares-fall-4-premarket-after-earnings-miss-2017-08-24). Hormel Foods Corp.'s(HRL) stock dropped 5.4% after the Spam maker cut its full-year earnings forecast.\nThe food companies were two of the biggest percentage decliners among S&P 500 components, and they pressured the consumer staples space.\nDollar Tree Inc.(DLTR) shares rallied 5.6% after the discount retailer reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/dollar-tree-shares-jump-9-premarket-on-better-than-expected-earnings-2017-08-24).\nPVH Corp.

Nasdaq-100 turned higher, rising 10.75 points, or 0.2%, to 5,858.75.\nThe indicated gains would mark a slight recovery, after the main indexes finished in the red Wednesday (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/dow-rally-poised-to-peter-out-as-jackson-hole-comes-back-into-focus-2017-08-23), undoing previous solid gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 index both fell 0.4%, while the Nasdaq Composite Index declined 0.3%.\nEquities' recent struggle has been put down in part (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-shutdown-threat-rattles-stock-market-2017-08-23) to U.S. President Donald Trump's threat late Tuesday to shut down the government if he did not get funding for a border wall with Mexico.\nWords from Wyoming: The program for the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank's symposium,, title \"Fostering a Dynamic Global Economy,\" is set for release (https://www.kansascityfed.org/publications/research/escp) at 6 p.m. Mountain Time, or 8 p.m. Eastern Time. The meeting runs through Saturday.\nEuropean Central Bank President Mario Draghi will be on the lineup with Yellen on Friday, and investors will watch for any hints on the path for monetary policy from both central bank chiefs.\n\"[Yellen's] speech is of great importance, given the recent warnings from the Fed on vulnerabilities associated with asset valuations. Few disagree that the global easy monetary policies have created overstretched valuations,\" said Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM.\n\"Whether it's stocks, fixed income, real estate or bitcoins, there is a bubble somewhere,\" he wrote.\nSee:Here's what investors will be watching when Draghi, Yellen speak at Jackson Hole (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-what-investors-will-be-watching-when-draghi-yellen-speak-at-jackson-hole-2017-08-22)\nEconomic docket: The Labor Department's report on weekly jobless claims, scheduled for release at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time, is expected to show a rise to 238,000.\nExisting home sales in July are expected to decline to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.50 million. The report from the National Association of Realtors is due at 10 a.m. Eastern.\nEarnings reports: Ahead of the bell, quarterly reports are due from Staples Inc.(SPLS) , and from jewelry retailers Tiffany & Co.(TIF) and Signet Jewelers Ltd. (SIG) . Food producers J.M. Smucker Co. (SJM) and Hormel Foods Corp.

      "text": "By Carla Mozee, MarketWatch\nTiffany, Staples earnings on deck; weekly jobless claims due\nU.S. stock futures edged higher Thursday, signaling a comeback from a rally-breaking prior session, on the starting day of the highly anticipated gathering of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyo.\nAhead of that symposium, fresh data on the U.S. labor market and a clutch of quarterly earnings from companies including Staples and Tiffany are scheduled for release.\nBut the highlight should be the central-bank summit, which has been on investors' minds this week, even though key speakers such as Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen won't appear until Friday.\n\"Markets are hoping for a change in sentiment that can take us off the recent risk-off mode,\" said Michala Marcussen, chief economist at Societe Generale, in a note.\n\"We are inclined to think that the Jackson Hole symposium will probably disappoint, with central bankers preferring to explain detailed actions in September,\" she said.\nFutures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 33 points, or 0.2%, to 21,828.00, while futures for the S&P 500 Index moved up 3 points, or 0.1%, to 2,444.50. Nasdaq-100 turned higher, rising 13.75 points, or 0.2%, to 5,861.75.\nThe indicated gains would mark a slight recovery, after the main indexes finished in the red Wednesday (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/dow-rally-poised-to-peter-out-as-jackson-hole-comes-back-into-focus-2017-08-23), undoing previous solid gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 index both fell 0.4%, while the Nasdaq Composite Index declined 0.3%.\nEquities' recent struggle has been put down in part (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-shutdown-threat-rattles-stock-market-2017-08-23) to U.S. President Donald Trump's threat late Tuesday to shut down the government if he did not get funding for a border wall with Mexico.\nWords from Wyoming: The program for the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank's symposium, titled \"Fostering a Dynamic Global Economy,\" is set for release (https://www.kansascityfed.org/publications/research/escp) at 6 p.m. Mountain Time, or 8 p.m. Eastern Time. The meeting runs through Saturday.\nEuropean Central Bank President Mario Draghi will be on the lineup with Yellen on Friday, and investors will watch for any hints on the path for monetary policy from both central bank chiefs.\n\"[Yellen's] speech is of great importance, given the recent warnings from the Fed on vulnerabilities associated with asset valuations. Few disagree that the global easy monetary policies have created overstretched valuations,\" said Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM.\n\"Whether it's stocks, fixed income, real estate or bitcoins, there is a bubble somewhere,\" he wrote.\nSee:Here's what investors will be watching when Draghi, Yellen speak at Jackson Hole (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-what-investors-will-be-watching-when-draghi-yellen-speak-at-jackson-hole-2017-08-22)\nEconomic docket: The Labor Department's report on weekly jobless claims, scheduled for release at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time, is expected to show a rise to 238,000.\nExisting home sales in July are expected to decline to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.50 million. The report from the National Association of Realtors is due at 10 a.m. Eastern.\nEarnings reports: Ahead of the bell, quarterly reports are due from Staples Inc.(SPLS), and from jewelry retailers Tiffany & Co.(TIF) and Signet Jewelers Ltd. (SIG) . Food producers J.M. Smucker Co. (SJM) and Hormel Foods Corp. (HRL) are also set to report before trading gets under way.\nOther markets:In Asian equities, (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/hong-kong-leads-slight-asian-market-gains-2017-08-23) Hong Kong shares finished higher while Japan's Nikkei lost ground. European equities traded modestly higher (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/european-stocks-post-cautious-gains-as-jackson-hole-day-arrives-2017-08-24).\nThe ICE Dollar Index was up 0.2% at 93.32. A single bitcoin was up 2% to $4,224.70.\nOil prices edged lower, while gold prices slipped 0.2% to $1,286.60 an ounce.\n 24, 2017 06:05 ET (10:05 ",

      "title": "Why Revolutionary Cryptocurrency Ripple Is Exploding Onto the Scene",
      "text": "Ripple [XRP] is currently the third most popular cryptocurrency after Bitcoin and Ethereum -- and the latest cryptocurrency set to revolutionize the financial services industry and is used by a number of banks.\nSo what are the benefits of Ripple and what sets this currency apart?\n\"Ripple provides one frictionless experience to send money globally using the power of blockchain,\" Ripple CTO Stefan Thomas told TheStreet . \"With RippleNet, financial institutions can process their customers' payments anywhere in the world, instantly, reliably and cost effectively using just one API. \"\nThomas says the vision is to enable the world to move money like information moves today, creating an internet of value. Ripple is making global waves on a global scale.\n\"Ripple is the only blockchain network with real customers - we've signed deals with over 90 customers globally and over 75 customers are in various stages of deploying Ripple for commercial use,\" said Thomas.\nRipple also recently announced it is growing its product suite, including xCurrent, xRapid and xVia. \"We are growing to serve our global customer base and now have offices in San Francisco, New York, London and Sydney - and a joint venture with SBI Ripple Asia to serve Asia,\" said Thomas.\nAre you investing in cryptocurrency ?

Why?\n\"Because XRP has a clear use case,\" Thomas said. \"It is one of the largest digital assets by market capitalization and is designed for use by financial institutions as an on-demand liquidity solution for cross-border payments. For example, payments into emerging markets can require multiple currency traders -- added costs -- or pre-funded local currency accounts -- which often results in trapped capital. Instead, payment providers and banks can use XRP to fund these payments on demand, without intermediaries, at up to 60% less cost to settle.\"\nBitcoin time.\nSpeed is another factor which comes into play. Thomas calimed XRP is also the fastest, most scalable and secure digital asset.\n\"XRP today can process up to 1,500 transactions per second on the XRP Ledger, which is supported by a community of trusted validators and a team of full-time engineers that actively develops and maintains the ledger,\" he said. \"Unlike other public blockchains that select validators via mining, XRP Ledger's validators are chosen by users and hosted using enterprise-grade infrastructure, making it the only enterprise-ready blockchain today.\"\nAnd its not just those connected to Ripple that are touting its potential cryptocurrency dominance. Given that Ripple is a centralized payment protocol operated by San Francisco-based Ripple Labs, which owns and controls most of the hosted XRP tokens, it has significant advantages.\n\"Instead of being an open, decentralized network like most other blockchains, Ripple Labs is a company that applies inherited blockchain and token technology to streamline an existing business,\" said Dominic Williams, president and chief scientist at DFINITY, a new decentralized blockchain network.\nOf course, as with this widely uncharted territory of cryptocurrency, there are inevitable risks.\n\"Though there is inherent value in Ripple's network, investors should be aware that the XRP currency is controlled by a single company, and indeed if it decided to liquidate a significant proportion of its holdings, the XRP price would fall dramatically,\" Williams added. \"Furthermore, the network itself depends upon the existence of Ripple Labs, rather than a large community of independent miners distributed around the world. For these reasons, arguably holders of XRP have far fewer security guarantees. \"\nDon't miss these top stories on TheStreet :\nWhy Revolutionary Cryptocurrency Ripple Is Exploding Onto the Scene Sears Is Closing a Ton More Stores Because Let's Face It, It's Sears The Samsung Galaxy Note 8 Camera Blows the iPhone 7 Plus Camera Out of the Water 50 Reasons Dying Sears Had No Choice But to Strike a Deal With the Ruthless Amazon This Is Why Janet Yellen's Jackson Hole Speech Could Destroy the Stock Market",

      "text": "By Wallace Witkowski, MarketWatch , Ryan Vlastelica\nJobless claims rise less than expected in latest week\nU.S. stocks switched between small gains and losses on Thursday during a seasonally low-volume period prone to swings, as investors focus on a symposium of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyo.\nThe market had received a slight boost in afternoon trade after House Speaker Paul Ryan expressed confidence in passing tax reform this year and raising the debt ceiling.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 11 points, or less than 0.1%, at 21,801, with shares of Cisco Systems Inc.(CSCO) leading advancers and shares of Wal-Mart Stores Inc.(WMT) the largest decliner.\nThe S&P 500 was down 3 points at 2,440, with six out of the 11 primary S&P 500 sectors moving lower, with consumer staples down 1% and telecom off 0.2%.\nThe Nasdaq Composite Index lost 11 points, or 0.2%, to 6,267.\nDuring a CNBC interview a little after 1 p.m. Eastern, Speaker Ryan said Republicans are \"eye to eye\" with President Donald Trump regarding policy. The statement comes after the president late Tuesday threatened to close down the federal government if he wasn't able to secure the estimated $1.6 billion in funding from Congress to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico.\nWith stocks experiencing their lightest trading volumes of the year, the market is very easy to influence, said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist, at Prudential Financial, in an interview.\n\"Ryan wasn't just positive but he provided more details than we have had so far,\" Krosby said. \"In a pragmatic manner, he laid out what congress is able to do, and that was helpful. That's something the market has been looking for.\"\nStocks had their lightest volume day of the year on Wednesday (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-stocks-trade-at-lightest-volume-of-year-on-wednesday-2017-08-23), with about 5 billion shares traded, well below the year-to-date average of 6.54 billion. Currently, 1.64 billion shares have traded on the New York Stock Exchange and 953 million have changed hands on the Nasdaq, with both on track to come in under the already light average daily volumes for August.\nThe latest economic data also painted a mixed picture of economic conditions. Jobless claims rose by 2,000 in the latest week, a smaller increase than expected. Separately, a read on new-home sales came in at 571,000, below the 608,000 that had been expected, while mortgage rates fell to their lowest level of the year (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/mortgage-rates-plunge-to-2017-low-2017-08-24).\nThe meeting of central bankers is likely to be the primary driver of trading, even though such key speakers as Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen won't appear until Friday.\n\"You can't underestimate the importance of Jackson Hole, and this year is especially interesting,\" said Brian Battle, director of trading at Performance Trust Capital Partners. \"Yellen's commentary will be closely watched, because investors want to know both if the Fed will be raising rates, and also the timing and the magnitude of the Fed unwinding its portfolio.\"\nFor the week, the Dow is on pace to gain 0.6%, the S&P 500 is set to add 0.6%, while the Nasdaq Composite is on track to rise 0.8%, a move that would end a four-week string of declines for the technology-heavy index.\nWords from Wyoming: The program for the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank's symposium, titled \"Fostering a Dynamic Global Economy,\" is set for release (https://www.kansascityfed.org/publications/research/escp) at 8 p.m. Eastern Time. The meeting runs through Saturday.\nEuropean Central Bank President Mario Draghi will be on the lineup with Yellen on Friday, and investors will watch for any hints on the path for monetary policy from both central bank chiefs.\nSee:Here's what investors will be watching when Draghi, Yellen speak at Jackson Hole (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-what-investors-will-be-watching-when-draghi-yellen-speak-at-jackson-hole-2017-08-22)\nStock movers:Tiffany & Co.(TIF) posted second-quarter earnings of 92 cents a share (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/tiffany-co-shares-rise-after-earnings-revenue-beat-2017-08-24), beating expectations.

Shares rose 1.1%.\nJ.M. Smucker Co. shares(SJM) fell 9.1% as the foods producer lowered its full-year outlook and its first-quarter earnings missed estimates (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/jm-smucker-shares-fall-4-premarket-after-earnings-miss-2017-08-24). Hormel Foods Corp.'s(HRL) stock dropped 5.4% after the Spam maker cut its full-year earnings forecast.\nDollar Tree Inc.(DLTR) shares rallied 6.6% after the discount retailer reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/dollar-tree-shares-jump-9-premarket-on-better-than-expected-earnings-2017-08-24).\nPVH Corp. (PVH) shares rose 5.6% after the Calvin Klein parent topped Wall Street estimates for the quarter and raised its outlook (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/calvin-klein-parent-pvh-corp-shares-rise-on-earnings-beat-raised-guidance-2017-08-23).\nThe food companies were the two biggest percentage decliners among S&P 500 components, and they pressured the consumer staples space.\nU.S.-listed shares of CRH PLC(CRG.DB) were up 4% after the Irish building materials company agreed to sell its Americas distribution business (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/crh-to-sell-us-distribution-unit-in-26b-deal-2017-08-24) to Beacon Roofing Supply(BECN). Beacon shares climbed 10%.\nA consortium that includes Western Digital Corp.(WDC) will offer 1.9 trillion yen ($17 billion) to purchase Toshiba Corp.'s(6502.TO) memory chip business, sources told Reuters on Thursday. (https://finance.yahoo.com/news/western-digital-group-offer-1-091619106.html)\n(https://finance.yahoo.com/news/western-digital-group-offer-1-091619106.html)Invesco Ltd. is reportedly closing in on a $1 billion deal (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/invesco-closes-in-on-1-billion-deal-to-buy-guggenheims-etf-business-2017-08-24) for Guggenheim Partners's ETF business.

The meeting has been on investors' minds this week, even though key speakers such as Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen won't appear until Friday.\n\"Markets are hoping for a change in sentiment that can take us off the recent risk-off mode,\" said Michala Marcussen, chief economist at Societe Generale, in a note.\n\"We are inclined to think that the Jackson Hole symposium will probably disappoint, with central bankers preferring to explain detailed actions in September,\" she said.\nFutures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 40 points, or 0.2%, to 21,835.00, while futures for the S&P 500 Index moved up 4.50 points, or 0.2%, to 2,446.00.

The meeting runs through Saturday.\nEuropean Central Bank President Mario Draghi will be on the lineup with Yellen on Friday, and investors will watch for any hints on the path for monetary policy from both central bank chiefs.\n\"[Yellen's] speech is of great importance, given the recent warnings from the Fed on vulnerabilities associated with asset valuations. Few disagree that the global easy monetary policies have created overstretched valuations,\" said Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM.\n\"Whether it's stocks, fixed income, real estate or bitcoins, there is a bubble somewhere,\" he wrote.\nSee:Here's what investors will be watching when Draghi, Yellen speak at Jackson Hole (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-what-investors-will-be-watching-when-draghi-yellen-speak-at-jackson-hole-2017-08-22)\nStock movers: Ahead of the bell, Tiffany & Co.(TIF) posted second-quarter earnings of 92 cents a share (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/tiffany-co-shares-rise-after-earnings-revenue-beat-2017-08-24), beating expectations.

The meeting runs through Saturday.\nEuropean Central Bank President Mario Draghi will be on the lineup with Yellen on Friday, and investors will watch for any hints on the path for monetary policy from both central bank chiefs.\n\"[Yellen's] speech is of great importance, given the recent warnings from the Fed on vulnerabilities associated with asset valuations.

      "text": "Cryptocurrency: Feedback is invited for estcoin idea August 24, 2017 by Nancy Owano Credit: CC0 Public Domain \n(Tech Xplore)—Cryptocurrencies are being talked about worldwide and now it looks as if Estonia could be one actor to take them to the next level. Estonia is thinking about issuing its own crypto token and holding an ICO. \nDiana Ngo in CoinJournal was one of several writers and news sites reporting on the idea. \nA proposal to issue so-called estcoins could involve running an initial coin offering (ICO). An ICO enables companies to crowdfund their finance. David Meyer in Fortune called it a \"trendy way of raising capital that gives investors virtual coins or tokens, rather than shares.\" \nEstonia seems a credible place to launch this sort of thing. Ngo referred to Estonia as a \"small and digitally advanced nation\" and having a successful e-Residency program. \nTo be sure, Estonia gained attention as forward-thinking when it comes to technology, in offering its e-Residency idea. TechCrunch said, \"The program is almost like a digital citizenship, and lets participants take advantage of a host of government services, including start a European Union-based company without actually setting foot in the country.\" \nThe latest statistics show Estonia has over 22,000 e-residents signed up from 138 countries. \nThe weekly application rate is higher than Estonia's weekly birth rate . \nEstonia e-Residency program managing director Kaspar Korjus authored an August 21 Medium post in which he spelled out his country's concept and the estcoin idea. \nAlmost three years ago, the question was asked, with Estonia having just 1.3 million residents, what would happen if there were digital residents too. Korjus said at that time \"every citizen and resident could already obtain a secure digital identity that enabled them to access Estonia's public services entirely online. This minimized bureaucracy and made every day life easier, especially for entrepreneurs. \"So then we wondered — why stop there?\" \nThe idea was that \"They could then enjoy many of our same advantages online, especially when it came to starting and running a company , no matter where in the world they are.\" \nSo what about these estcoins? These would be the Republic of Estonia's own crypto token. Ngo said that they would be available to \"e-residents\" looking to support Estonia's broader \"new digital nation\" plan. \nIn his Medium blog, Korjus said Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin had \"a keen interest in Estonia's development as a digital nation and has provided valuable feedback for the estcoin proposal.\" If estcoins were issued on top of a blockchain, possibly issued in multiple formats at the same time, it would be easy to use them inside of smart contracts and other applications. \nKorjus said the estcoins could be accessed by anyone in the world through the e-Residency program and launched through the ICO. \"In time, estcoins could also be accepted as payment for both public and private services and eventually function as a viable currency used globally. \" \nAs for competition, Ngo wrote that \"For some industry observers, estcoin could directly compete against decentralized cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.\" \nFor now, though, some steps need to be taken to get this idea under way. \nKorjus on his post is inviting feedback. \n\"Should Estonia begin issuing its own crypto tokens to e-residents (as well as citizens and residents)? Can a country have its own ICO? If so, what should be the biggest considerations in how these crypto tokens are developed? What do you think the impact of these crypto tokens could be, both for Estonia and for e-residents?\" \nIf the proposal garners support, the next stage, before the ICO, would be a white paper, he said, that outlines the value of estcoins and \"how the investment will be used to develop our digital nation. It is likely to begin as a pilot project that can be scaled up based on demand.\" \nAs for the bigger picture, \"Eventually governments will adopt digital cryptocurrencies . It's just a matter of when, and in what form,\" Fitz Tepper said in TechCrunch . \n\"Will the United States ever replace the dollar with bitcoin? Absolutely not. But will they supplement their gold reserves with bitcoin or another cryptocurrency? Much more likely, especially if Bitcoin becomes a major part of the U.S financial system,\" he added. \nKorjus, meanwhile, understands why acceptance of cryptocurrencies has hardly been overnight. \"It has understandably taken time for all governments to understand and embrace cryptocurrencies as they have a duty to address major challenges, such as the risk of money laundering. In the long term, however, governments may have no option but to (literally) accept cryptocurrencies.\" 14 shares ",

They say the technology underpinning digital currencies like Bitcoin   transform the way we store and share data online— from today’s highly centralized model, where a few companies hold all the cards, to something more reminiscent of the Web in its earlier days. \nBut this vision will hinge on much more than technical innovation; it also faces complicated economic and social barriers. That’s a big takeaway from a new analysis (PDF), published by MIT researchers, that takes an in-depth look at problems associated with centralization—censorship, algorithmic bias, and privacy and security concerns , to name a few—and at potential avenues for breaking things open . \nA promising technical approach is inspired by the digital currency Bitcoin, which has made it feasible for people to make digital payments peer to peer, without a central bank or credit card company as an intermediary. Bitcoin’s power lies in its blockchain, a cryptographic ledger that records every single transaction and is accessible to anyone with the Bitcoin software. Maintenance of the Bitcoin network is carried out by computers all over the world, so no central authority is in charge (see “ What Bitcoin Is, and Why It Matters ”). \nBlockchains can be used for other things besides payments , too. The company Blockstack, for example, uses a blockchain to track usernames and encryption keys, the basis of a new kind of identity system that would not be tied any single social network or other website. \nIt’s a promising approach for giving individuals more control over their data. But breaking old habits and challenging entrenched business models is very difficult. Besides Blockstack, the MIT researchers examined several other early examples of decentralized services, finding a common thread: “The challenge is not just building decentralized software and creating alternative platforms, but creating options for users that are financially sustainable, usable, and compelling.” Source: Swipe Up To Dismiss San Francisco Will Consider a Tax on Robots \nWhen robots steal our jobs, should they be made to pay taxes?

That’s something residents of San Francisco are being asked to think about by Jane Kim, who represents the city's District 6 on its board of supervisors. She wants to find cash to help folks out with retraining or a universal basic income when robots take over their toils, and the suggestion for generating that money is a tax on robots. \nSan Francisco certainly isn’t stuffed full of robots right now. But it’s easy enough to imagine a none-too-distant future where autonomous taxis rule the roads and burgers are flipped by bots . In a context where robots are taking over directly from human workers, the idea seems to make sense. But similar suggestions in the past— most notably from Bill Gates —have been dismissed, in part because taxing robots disincentivizes companies from adopting them, leading to a failure to capitalize on increases in productivity that can stimulate the economy. \nThat’s not the only problem with the suggestion. “We’re still working on what defines a robot and what defines job displacement,” Kim admitted in an interview with Wired . “Announcing the opening of the campaign committee is going to also allow us to have discussions throughout the state in terms of what the actual measure would look like.” Kim is, in fact, fairly philosophical about the outcome of her initiative, seeing it more as a conversation starter about how to prepare for the future than a hard-and-fast plan. \nIn reality, it’s not clear what the best way to impose taxes on automation is. Earlier this year, the Economist weighed what such a thing might look like. Taxing capital investment in robots or the increased profits as a result of their installation, the two obvious ways to go about it, don’t seem to be a perfect solution, according to the magazine’s analysis. \nThere are other ways to tackle the problem that don’t focus on the machines, though: reducing tax on human labor, perhaps, or aggressively taxing the world’s most successful firms that make best use of automation. But it’s still unclear which would work best. Maybe initiatives like Kim’s will spur the kind of thinking required to get to the bottom of the problem. Source:",

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. BTC/USD 24.08.2017 The BTC/USD pair has seen an increase in volatility over the last several days. One could also witness a false hit, which happened on Aug. 22. Closure of marginal market positions led to such a rapid movement. However, the recovery was fast, which once again has proved the strength of the $3,900 zone. Technically, the situation is as follows: The $4,400 resistance zone has proven strong. In case of $4,400 hit and confident settling, a new rally is likely to happen. Support zone of the $3,900 zone. Despite the false hit, the support zone is still around $3,900. But one should be careful since volatility is strong and short-term stop order moves might not be the best decision right now. False hit. Study this movement carefully, it shows how the market works and why BTC price moves up or down. The $3,900-$4,400 channel is likely to keep on in the coming weeks, along with buys from lower borders of the channel and sells from the upper borders. It’s a possible scenario, but on the current market, opening short positions might not be a good idea. An important factor to consider here is trading volume. BTC-related news has been positive. The SegWit activation and fight for mining powers with BCH have led to an increasing news flow and growing popularity of Bitcoin. ETH/USD 24.08.2017 Ethereum is one of the strongest projects on the cryptomarket. Technological solutions that ETH offers are in high demand there. The rising number of transactions in the network only proves the point. Yet, ETH has its problems. Slow network during major ICOs has not left a very good impression. And the market tends to react instantly to any problem. But most importantly, one should not forget that Ethereum has a very strong team of developers. They all do understand the problems and are working on their solutions. And this is what makes Ethereum one of the best assets for investors on a fundamental level. Technically, the situation is as follows: Strong ETH uptrend continues $280 remains to be a resistance zone $320 resistance zone has been hit, but the retest has failed. There has been a return to the $280-$320 channel. Right now the price trades around the $320 resistance zone. For further growth, the trading volumes and general market dynamics are very important factors. Volatility remains high. News about the nearest hard fork has generated heat around ETH. One should pay special attention to the Difficulty Bomb. This will influence ETH price very positively. This is one more step from PoW to PoS. Influence of fundamental factors makes the technical analysis just a support instrument. The Metropolis release has been the spotlight of the Ethereum network. News about its activation will heat up the interest to the project. Options with correction to the $280 support zone are also possible, but only if the whole market falls. LTC/USD 24.08.2017 We finally saw some movement with LTC. It was caused by news from developers on tests and activation of Lightning Network. Judging by Charlie Li’s Twitter account , the white paper and the results of LN tests will be published very soon. We’ve already seen the first reaction, a second wave can follow after a full-blown announcement. Technical analysis: The last peak has been tested. Triangle formation is possible. Therefore, buys from support zones, probably, will not be possible. Very positive news; the LN tests. Bids on LTC have also gone up. A usual LTC bid is one to two percent a year. Right now, one can loan LTC at 11.95 percent a year. This is also an important trigger during growth; one can consider when building a strategy. In this case, the same as with Ethereum, news will play an important role. Potential Lightning Network activation will impact the price a lot, and can even make Litecoin a leader in growth on the whole digital currency market. A very strong rally may still be possible, and strong movement that took place during SegWit activation can take place once again. Follow Cointelegraph on Twitter",

      "text": "Here’s another reason to be leery of the initial coin offerings being done at a staggering pace in the cryptocurrency world: there’s a one-in-10 chance you’ll end up a victim of theft.\nPhishing scams have helped push up criminal losses to about $225 million this year, according to Chainalysis, a New York-based firm that analyzes transactions and provides anti-money laundering software. In such scams, investors are tricked into sending money to internet addresses pretending to be funding sites for digital token offerings related to the ethereum blockchain technology.\nMore than 30 000 people have fallen prey to ethereum-related cyber crime, losing an average of $7 500 each, with ICOs amassing about $1.6 billion in proceeds this year, Chainalysis estimates.\n“It’s a huge amount of money to generate in such a short period of time,” said Jonathan Levin, co-founder of Chainalysis, whose software and database are used by some of the largest bitcoin companies and US law enforcement agencies. “The cryptocurrency phishers are doing pretty good against all the other types of criminals that are out there.”\nIndeed, the huge amount of wealth that has fallen prey to cyber criminals is approaching the losses incurred by robberies in the US for the entire year of 2015, which stood at $390 million, according to statistics released by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\nICOs are digital token sales typically that raise ether, with users transferring the funds to addresses provided by startups. Investors, sometimes eager to get early access to new token offerings have been tricked into providing their credentials to fake websites through targeted email campaigns, twitter posts and Slack messages, said Levin.\nEther rose 0.3% to $324.92 on Thursday, according to data from coindesk, while bitcoin rose 0.4% to $4 151.47.\nMost attacks involve creating websites or social media accounts that sound similar to the real ICO project. Levin gave the fictional example of a project named “illuminate,” which an imposter might fake by spelling it as “iIIuminate.” Using the fake account, they would solicit potential investors to send money to the criminal’s address.\nHis firm compiled the data by identifying so-called digital wallets used by scam artists. That information is usually public because criminals widely circulate it, hoping to fool investors into sending them money.\nOther common forms of crime involve tapping into project loopholes. The DAO, or decentralized autonomous organization, is a smart contract project built on top of ethereum that was intended to democratize how ethereum projects are funded. A bug in the system was exploited and that led to the theft of $55 million worth of ether at the time.\nLevin didn’t provide data for bitcoin-related cybercrime, and not because it is any safer. He said such data is harder to track as scams are usually specific attacks on individual holders, rather than ICO-related campaigns which try to dupe many people at once.\n“The overall figures mean there are infrastructure that we need to build to help prevent people from getting abused,” said Levin.\n© 2017 Bloomberg L.P\nCan we provide you with information on a FICA management tool?

      "text": "Aug 24 Forget Traditional Investors. Why Not Try an ICO? It’s your fifth meeting with a potential VC investor. You have done everything they asked: adjusted your business model, covered every possible corner of a ridiculous 5 year budget. You think to yourself, is this all redundant? The time, the effort. You have a vision and a plan. You have worked out scenarios on how it can evolve. But instead of focusing your vision and plan, you find your main focus to be chasing investors.. Before the exhaustion sets in, consider something new, a model in which you get to present your vision and concept, while the public decides to invest in your vision and concept. No I’m not talking about crowdfunding — I’m talking about Initial Coin Offering (ICO). So how does it work? Startups are able to launch their own cryptocurrency in the form of a token where people can purchase on a distributed ledger such as Ethereum . The technology through which transactions are made is called blockchain. People purchase your token using the most popular cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin or Ether. In order for the token to earn value, it needs to be used for the service/product your startup is making. Are you creating a marketplace? Does your new game app give credits during game play? If you launch your own token then you must make sure it will be part of your startup’s eco-system. By doing that, your token will, in time, increase in value. The more people who use it means your early adopters make substantial wealth holding onto your token. Thus, while your business grows, so does the value of your token. The business plan that a startup produces to the public for interested crypto investors is called a White Paper (WP). You can view an example of our WP for your reference here . After you create your WP, make sure to share it and make it open for everyone, so as to allow them to give feedback. This allows you to gain trust with potential investors while also improving your business plan to increase your chances of success after your ICO. Some people say ICOs are the ‘Wild West of of finance.’ And there is some truth to that. If you are an investor, it is important that you are aware that there are scams out there. I have read through many WP’s; while there are some amazing startups that can earn an investor a substantial amount of money with their promised execution, some are complete scams. We recommend checking out icoindex.com — which analyzes and posts about such scams  — here . Irregardless, the ICO wave is happening now. Cryptocurrency is at an all-time high with a market cap of 125 billion. Due to the rise of Bitcoin and Ether, people have excess coins to reinvest in the infrastructure of blockchain and market places for cryptocurrencies, creating the ground work of the future of finance. I have been that person at a fifth meeting waiting for a decision. And that’s why I am pursuing an ICO. While fintech companies struggle for investment because their vision could in fact hurt banks or corporates connected with accelerators and VC’s, why not try this new approach? The next stage is to actually create a bridge that introduces salaries to cryptocurrencies in order to unleash real markets where you can purchase from anywhere. This is why I am creating an ICO. I want to be that bridge where the community can co-create with businesses and receive crypto in return. This is a way to establish creative jobs and to prevent a future where technological automation creates vast-unemployment, while simultaneously enabling the drastic wealth increase of automating brokers who leach off people’s wealth (as they do on Wall Street.) By using blockchain, you can automate them ! The future is near, and it is exciting. To learn more about my startup’s ICO, check out our landing page here: ico.crowdholding.com . Now is the best time to avoid traditional investors and launch an ICO, because one thing is for sure: this new alternative finance is boundless. ",

      "text": "Blockchain enthusiast, metalhead, video game lover, successful reproducer Aug 24 Tokenbox — an ecosystem for cryptoinvestors, traders, and funds Tokenbox is solving a problem in the blockchain industry: how to make it easy and simple for investors to get involved. There have been high barriers to entry from the very beginning of the blockchain economy, and despite the efforts of a lot of different projects, it still hasn’t become much simpler for anything but the simplest of operations. It no longer requires a great deal of technical savvy to acquire bitcoins and ether, the two biggest cryptocurrencies, but it’s still not convenient. But investors want to do more than just hold bitcoin and ether, they want a diversified set of cryptoasset holdings to increase growth and also hedge against putting all of their eggs in one basket. The founders of Tokenbox had an initial solution to this, which was The Tokenfund , a diversified asset portfolio of cryptocurrencies that provides a very good return on investment. It soon became clear though that this solution could be turned into something much more flexible and innovative in order to meet the needs of discerning investors. Tokenbox is a much larger scale solution to meet the asset management needs of both private and institutional investors who are looking to enter the blockchain space. A big feature that is commonly missing from many crypto projects is the initial gateway of turning fiat into cryptocurrency, but this will be a core feature of Tokenbox, making getting into cryptoinvesting easier than buying stocks or putting stakes in a mutual fund. Many investors are well-aware of ICOs, and they’ve seen the huge returns that have been generated by several projects in the space. With the pooled power of its users, Tokenbox will provide early access to promising ICOs. Tokenbox provides a clean, user-friendly interface that will make it easy for clients to peruse ratings and make informed decisions while setting up their fund portfolio. Tokenbox currently supports several main modules that allow users to transfer fund management operations to smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, along with processing, back end operations, parsers for controlling balances, the calculation of individual returns, and an electronic wallet. For funds, traders, and investors using the platform, the benefits are huge. Legal coverage, KYC, reliable payments, liquidity, ratings, data security, and access to the ICO marketplace are all part of the package that Tokenbox offers its users. Our management team offers competency, experience, and a proven track record of success in digital asset management in the crypto space, having given investors in The Tokenfund a 240% ROI since its inception in March, 2017. TBX will be the unique token that will be the internal currency of the Tokenbox platform. The liquidity and investment potential of TBX will be further supported by the reserve fund of the platform, and will also be listed on prominent crypto exchanges for additional liquidity. Whether you’re a novice or an experienced investor looking to diversify your holdings, Tokenbox has a solution for you. In September we will be having a private pre-sale that features 50% bonus TBX tokens, and in October we will host our official Token Generation Event (TGE). ",

      "title": "Dollar gains as Jackson Hole gathering gets under way - MarketWatch",
      "text": "The U.S. dollar on Thursday gave up its modest momentum against its main counterparts to trade little changed as a meeting of key central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyo., which could provide clues about the direction of global financial policy, got under way.\nA gauge of the dollar against a half-dozen rivals, the ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, +0.12% steadied at 93.3050, off an intraday high of 93.38, while a broader measure of the buck’s strength, the WSJ Dollar Index BUXX, +0.02% moved 0.2% higher to 86.16 late Thursday in New York.\nThe market was on tenterhooks ahead of key talks of European Central Bank President Mario Draghi and Federal Reserve boss Janet Yellen set for Friday, market participants said. The Jackson Hole symposium hosted by the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank, titled “Fostering a Dynamic Global Economy,” kicked off on Thursday and runs through Saturday.\nRead: Here’s what investors will be watching when Draghi, Yellen speak at Jackson Hole\nTraders will be watching for any signals on the path for policy as Draghi contends with signs of improvement in the eurozone economy and Yellen aims to normalize the interest-rate regime in the U.S., though not many expect the speeches to include much in terms of new policy stances.\nSee: How one central bank cowboy at Jackson hole has fallen behind—and may be spurred to act\nBoth central bankers have been bedeviled by an intractable bout of sluggish inflation that has refused to pick up steam, running below targets of roughly 2%, even as employment and other economic gauges around the world regain a semblance of vibrancy. Both the Yellen and Draghi speeches could set the tone for the remaining four months of 2017, even if they don’t include explicit policy details.\n“Market participants expect Draghi to be neutral to hawkish if he directly comments on ECB monetary policy. But I think this is wishful thinking and see it as quite likely that he will disappoint,” Alejandro Zambrano, chief market analyst at brokerage Amana Capital, said, adding that hawkish comments would likely fuel further gains of the euro, making eurozone inflation targets harder to reach in the medium term. With muted inflation in mind, ECB tapering might take longer than hoped for, Zambrano said.\nAhead of those events, the euro EURUSD, -0.0593% weakened slightly against the dollar. One euro bought $1.1802 on Thursday, clawing back losses from an intraday low of $1.1784, and compared with $1.1808 late Thursday in New York, when the shared currency got a bounce after an upbeat report on manufacturing activity in the region.\nThe pound GBPUSD, +0.0312% meanwhile, gained some ground after weakening against greenback in the previous session throughout Thursday to nearly unchanged at $1.2798, compared with $1.2799 late Wednesday.\nSteve Barrow, head of G-10 currency strategy at Standard Bank, described the current trading environment for foreign exchange as a “mess.”\n“Our indicators have started to become both more mixed and weaker; in short a bit of a mess. This suggests that we should be cautious about opening new positions at this stage,” he wrote in a Thursday research note.\nIn North American trade, Canada’s dollar was higher against the buck, while the Mexican peso lost some ground again, after it was rattled in Wednesday trade by President Donald Trump’s comments during a Phoenix speech, where he threatened a government shutdown if he couldn’t obtain funding for a U.S.-Mexico border wall. He also suggested that a key trade pact, the North American Free Trade Agreement, would likely be scrapped.\nRead : Trump ‘shutdown’ threat rattles stock market\nThe buck bought 17.7222 pesos USDMXN, -0.0705% after hitting a low of 17.6373 pesos on Thursday, compared with 17.6855 pesos in the prior session. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar USDCAD, -0.0719% fetched C$1.2528, versus C$1.2553 on Wednesday.\nIn Asia, the dollar strengthened against the Japanese yen USDJPY, +0.05% which tends to rise against rivals in times of perceived uncertainty in the market, was at ¥109.56, compared with ¥109.04 late Wednesday in New York.\nIn economic news, weekly initial jobless claims beat expectations at 234,000, compared with 238,000 expected. They rose from 232,000 before. Separately, existing-home sales ran at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.44 million, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. That was down 1.3% reduced from its June pace. While July’s pace was 2.1% higher than a year ago, it was the lowest since last August.\nMore from MarketWatch More Coverage Why Americans should steer clear of Mexico We just might be in a bitcoin bubble when...

      "title": "Ex-Barclays boss Antony Jenkins: Banks lag behind blockchain momentum",
      "text": "A former Barclays CEO reinforced his warning that big banks may fall behind in the race towards harnessing new financial technologies like blockchain.\nAntony Jenkins, who led the bank through a tumultuous period between 2012 and 2015, told CNBC that though banks tended to be good at innovating, they were struggling to transform in the way that outsiders were.\n\"I think what we see in all industries, especially in financial services, is that incumbents (banks) tend to be quite good at innovation – they throw a lot of resources at that – and then the transformation is much harder for them,\" Jenkins told CNBC in an interview on Thursday.\nHe said that big technology firms and financial technology start-ups were dominating the space.\n\"If you look at all the interesting work on transformation, it's really going outside the big incumbents. And the incumbents themselves are starting to realize this.\"\nOn Tuesday, a report by the World Economic Forum found that banks were significantly lagging behind tech giants in the development of technologies like cloud computing, artificial intelligence and big data analytics. The study also concluded that fintech firms failed to disrupt the competitive landscape of the financial services in the way that they had hoped.\nBlockchain removes need for middle men Blockchain records a digital ledger of transactions via a distributed network, thereby ruling out the need for supervision by middle men. Its most common use is for trading cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin .\nBarclays' former boss said that the banking system was being held down by the requirement for central authorities.\n\"If you think about it, if just you and I lived in the world – you had money, I needed money – we'd do that between us. There's billions of people in the world, so we have a banking system,\" he told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\".\n\"But what a banking system does is have a series of centralized counterparties that tend to concentrate on risk. And when you concentrate on risk you have to have a lot of capital underpinning that, and it creates friction in the system.\"\nshow chapters Bank branch closure happening faster than expected, says ex-Barclays CEO 4:44 AM ET Thu, 24 Aug 2017 | 02:18 The former banking executive said that while blockchain began as a fringe technology, ignored by mainstream financial services, its true potential is coming close to being realized.\n\"I think this is like all technological developments we see. It starts off quite small and on the periphery of life, and most incumbent players – in this case the banks – tend to ignore it and sort of hope it will go away. And then they begin to pay attention to it and do a few experiments in it,\" he said.\n\"But meanwhile, the real learning and knowledge is being built off to the side here.\"\nOn Tuesday, IBM announced it would allow food giants like Nestle , Unilever and Wal-Mart to use its blockchain network to track information about the origin, condition and movement of food.\nMortgages, credit granted within minutes Jenkins added that distributed ledger technology could result in mortgages and credit being issued to customers in a matter of minutes.\n\"Over time what you could see for example, is a mortgage being granted in 10 minutes, you could see a letter of credit being granted in two minutes, those types of things,\" he said.\n\"And while we're not there yet, we will be there over the coming five, ten, fifteen years, and that has the effect of squeezing out a huge amount of margin and profit for the banking system, which is basically made out of inefficiency.\"\nshow chapters Regulators see fintech as supportive, ex-Barclays CEO says 4:45 AM ET Thu, 24 Aug 2017 | 01:31 In June the business leader said that banks could be faced with their own \"Kodak moment\" and become \"as common as a Blockbuster video store\" if they failed to keep up with the pace of rapidly evolving financial technologies.\nHe said that the opportunities produced by digital ledgers could result in efficiency savings of between $80 billion-$110 billion.\nIn 2015, Jenkins was ousted by Barclays. In an interview with the BBC that year, he said that he found his sacking \"surprising\".\nHe declined to comment further on the matter in an interview today.\nHis fintech start-up 10x Future Technologies is building digital banking platforms for a number of clients, including the challenger bank Virgin Money , founded by billionaire Richard Branson in 1995.\nHe told CNBC: \"We are building the platform now. We'll launch with Virgin Money, our first client, next year. And we're in discussions with a number of other banks and subsequent clients.\"\nWATCH: What is blockchain? show chapters What is Blockchain? 3:15 PM ET Fri, 2 June 2017 | 04:44",

      "text": "By Wallace Witkowski, MarketWatch , Ryan Vlastelica\nJobless claims rise less than expected in latest week\nU.S. stocks closed slightly lower Thursday, after a session of switching between small gains and losses, during a seasonally low-volume period prone to swings, as investors focused on a symposium of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyo.\nThe market had received a brief boost in afternoon trade after House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., expressed confidence in passing a tax-overhaul package this year and raising the debt ceiling.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 28.69 points, or 0.1%, at 21,783.40, with shares of Cisco Systems Inc.(CSCO) leading advancers and shares of Wal-Mart Stores Inc.(WMT) the largest decliner.\nThe S&P 500 declined 5.07 points, or 0.2%, to close at 2,438.97, with 10 out of the 11 primary S&P 500 sectors finishing lower, with consumer staples down 1.3% and industrials down 0.4%.\nThe Nasdaq Composite Index closed down 7.08 points, or 0.1%, at 6,271.33.\nDuring a CNBC interview a little after 1 p.m. Eastern, Ryan said Republicans are \"eye to eye\" with President Donald Trump regarding policy. The statement comes after the president late Tuesday threatened to close down the federal government if he wasn't able to secure the estimated $1.6 billion in funding from Congress to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico.\nWith stocks experiencing their lightest trading volumes of the year, the market is very easy to influence, said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist, at Prudential Financial, in an interview.\n\"Ryan wasn't just positive but he provided more details than we have had so far,\" Krosby said. \"In a pragmatic manner, he laid out what congress is able to do, and that was helpful. That's something the market has been looking for.\"\nStocks had their lightest volume day of the year on Wednesday (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-stocks-trade-at-lightest-volume-of-year-on-wednesday-2017-08-23), with about 5 billion shares traded, well below the year-to-date average of 6.54 billion. At the close, 2.76 billion shares had traded on the New York Stock Exchange and 1.52 billion had changed hands on the Nasdaq, both well below the already light average daily volumes for August.\nThe latest economic data also painted a mixed picture of economic conditions. Jobless claims rose by 2,000 in the latest week, a smaller increase than expected. Separately, a read on new-home sales came in at 571,000, below the 608,000 that had been expected, while mortgage rates fell to their lowest level of the year (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/mortgage-rates-plunge-to-2017-low-2017-08-24).\nThe meeting of central bankers is likely to be the primary driver of trading, even though such key speakers as Federal Reserve won't appear until Friday.\n\"You can't underestimate the importance of Jackson Hole, and this year is especially interesting,\" said Brian Battle, director of trading at Performance Trust Capital Partners. \"Yellen's commentary will be closely watched, because investors want to know both if the Fed will be raising rates, and also the timing and the magnitude of the Fed unwinding its portfolio.\"\nFor the week, the Dow is on pace to gain 0.5%, the S&P 500 is set to add 0.6%, while the Nasdaq Composite is on track to rise 0.9%, a move that would end a four-week string of declines for the technology-heavy index.\nWords from Wyoming: The program for the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank's symposium, titled \"Fostering a Dynamic Global Economy,\" is set for release (https://www.kansascityfed.org/publications/research/escp) at 8 p.m. Eastern Time. The meeting runs through Saturday.\n will be on the lineup with Yellen on Friday, and investors will watch for any hints on the path for monetary policy from both central bank chiefs.\nOil prices (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/oil-prices-ease-with-caution-still-in-place-even-as-us-stockpiles-decline-2017-08-24) dropped 2% to settle at $47.43 a barrel as Hurricane Harvey (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-gulf-of-mexico-storm-harvey-is-bearish-for-oil-2017-08-24)bore down on the Gulf of Mexico, home to about 17% of U.S. crude production.

Nasdaq-100 added 22 points, or 0.4%, to 5,869.75.\nMarket participants also digested the latest economic data, which showed that jobless claims rose by 2,000 in the latest week. However, the labor market remains strong. Claims are coming off a six-month low and the increase in the latest week was below forecasts.\nDespite that, the meeting of central bankers is likely to be the primary driver of trading, even though key speakers such as Federal Reserve won't appear until Friday.\n\"Markets are hoping for a change in sentiment that can take us off the recent risk-off mode,\" said Michala Marcussen, chief economist at Société Générale, in a note.\n\"We are inclined to think that the Jackson Hole symposium will probably disappoint, with central bankers preferring to explain detailed actions in September,\" she said.\nThe indicated gains would mark a slight recovery, after the main indexes finished in the red Wednesday (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/dow-rally-poised-to-peter-out-as-jackson-hole-comes-back-into-focus-2017-08-23), undoing previous solid gains.

The meeting runs through Saturday.\n will be on the lineup with Yellen on Friday, and investors will watch for any hints on the path for monetary policy from both central bank chiefs.\n\"[Yellen's] speech is of great importance, given the recent warnings from the Fed on vulnerabilities associated with asset valuations. Few disagree that the global easy monetary policies have created overstretched valuations,\" said Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM.\nSee:\nStock movers:Tiffany & Co.(TIF) posted second-quarter earnings of 92 cents a share (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/tiffany-co-shares-rise-after-earnings-revenue-beat-2017-08-24), beating expectations.

      "text": "Financial news and economic items of interest Thursday, August 24, 2017 10:44 AM blockchain , crypto-ruble , cryptocurrency , currency , ethereum , ruble , russia No Comments \nWhile the West continues to fumble around with manipulation of their sovereign fiat currencies, Russia has now decided to go full bore into both the blockchain, and the cryptocurrency sphere. And on Aug. 24 the Kremlin announced they are already working on the creation of the Crypto-Ruble for use in everyday commerce. Russia has plans to introduce its own digital currency running on blockchain technology, according to First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov. The FSB \"is actively working at the international level and wants to ensure that security issues are solved from the very beginning,\" Shuvalov told RBC channel. He stressed cryptocurrencies can no longer be \"locked in a chest and hidden,” and should make the national economy stronger, not put it at risk. Shuvalov said blockchain technology has a far greater use than just cryptocurrencies. \"Blockchain for us is not only about the ability to generate the equivalent of bank notes. It also provides a mechanism for a professional, transparent and fast public service,\" the minister said. Russia does not yet recognize bitcoin and other digital currencies. The Central Bank of Russia is evaluating whether virtual cash should be treated as a currency or a digital asset. The second largest cryptocurrency ethereum and its founder, Russian-born Vitalik Buterin, are working to adopt blockchain technology in Russia. Ethereum was worth over $30 billion on Thursday. The company's representative in Russia Vladislav Martynov told RT in June that “in five years Russia could become a global center for blockchain expertise. The country plans to attract and teach programmers blockchain technology and then offer the world expertise.”– RussiaToday ",

      "text": "Browse: Home Mainstream Bitcoin The Bitcoin Sovereign Wealth Fund The Bitcoin Sovereign Wealth Fund   The Bitcoin Sovereign Wealth Fund \nThe crypto-currency boom is in full swing. The explosion in price and quantity of new digital tokens is so bonkers even its evangelists are calling the market a ticking time-bomb . \nBitcoin’s gain 1,323% \nIt’s also tempting the establishment to get in on the act. For the Republic of Estonia, it’s being touted as a way to raise a sovereign wealth fund — an imaginative leap for a country with a population one-sixth the size of New York City’s and one of the highest levels of mobile broadband penetration in the world. \nA Bitcoin-Ready Nation? \nWireless mobile broadband subscriptions per 100 inhabitants, Q2 2016 \nSource: OECD \nA proposal by Estonia’s agency in charge of “e-residency” applications (more on this later) has suggested raising money by selling “estcoins” to the public. \nThe wealth could then be managed via a public-private partnership; a chunk might be poured into venture capital to support domestic start-ups. Holders of estcoins would have a stake in the fund and a say in how it is run. The tokens might then become a viable currency, so the thinking goes, paying for goods and services in a euro-zone country. \nThis seems like a bid to add financial firepower to a tiny economy whose capital markets are under-developed and eclipsed by loans from foreign banks. More than 90% of the Estonian market is controlled by foreign firms like Swedbank, SEB and Nordea, according to investment bank Redgate Capital. \nA Gap To Fill \nEstonia’s banking market is highly concentrated and dwarfs under-developed capital markets \nSource: Redgate Capital \nEstonia lacks the natural resources of Norway or Qatar, but has reinvented itself as digitally savvy economy that’s open for business: corporate and income tax rates are less than the OECD average, it ranks twelfth globally in terms of ease of doing business and allows anyone in the world to become an “e-resident” and start a company. With Estonia’s e-population apparently growing faster than the domestic birth rate, tapping this group for funds must be a temptation. \nHot Market, Burnt Fingers \nBitcoin trackers reflect the crypto-currency boom, where daily price swings can be huge \nSource: Bloomberg \nBut there are huge risks here. The price of crypto-currencies is incredibly volatile: Bitcoin has jumped 340 percent year-to-date, and in 2013 it once fell 50 percent overnight . \nIn theory, an estcoin would be backed by hard assets like infrastructure projects or cash flows from investments, so might be easier to value. \nIn practice, there’s no telling how these coins would trade and how they might destabilize Estonia’s economy and politics. Would this new coin create two classes of citizens, depending on whether their savings were in euros or estcoins? Would Estonia repay debts in either currency, or both? Any outsized influence of foreigners who are also e-residents might lead to extra friction — imagine a deep-pocketed overseas investor owning more than half of the republic’s flag-waving token. \nA sovereign crypto-currency backed by people whose personal details are stored online would also surely be a juicy magnet for hackers and criminals. \nThe estcoin proposal seems to be leaning towards Ethereum as technology of choice and has received feedback from its founder, Vitalik Buterin — who has also been in contact with Vladimir Putin about Russia’s own crypto ambitions . \nEthereum has a choppy history of community-managed investment funds: One such experiment, the DAO, was hacked in a $55 million digital heist . Estonia also has a history of being targeted by cyber-attacks. In 2007 , banks, media outlets and government bodies were forced offline. Estonia blamed Russia , which denied involvement. People might also target estcoins to bypass the regulated banking system. \nA $120 Billion Market \nMarket capitalization of the top five crypto-currencies \nSource: Coincap \nThis is a proposal that’s still at the conceptual stage, and the agency involved acknowledges there are risks that need to be addressed before taking any step forward. There’s little doubt that in the current mood of crypto-enthusiasm, where millions are being thrown at dubious business propositions, an estcoin would succeed in raising money. The long-term cost could well be volatility, insecurity and poverty. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.

      "text": "Home Cryptocurrencies News Australia Accuses Bitcoin of Growth in Organized Crime Australia Accuses Bitcoin of Growth in Organized Crime August 25, 2017 bitcointrendingnews Cryptocurrencies News , How to Buy Bitcoins , What is Bitcoin 0 \nThe Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission (ACIC) has found the culprit for the growth in organized crime in Australia – cryptocurrencies and online banking services. According to a recent report conducted by ACIC, major criminal organizations that are involved in money laundering are costing the country over $28.34 billion annually. \nLearn how to buy Bitcoin and Ethereum safely with our simple guide! \nAustralian authorities have expressed concern that e-commerce businesses and Bitcoin exchanges assist in facilitating criminal activities, as they lack transparency regarding transactions and encryption. Justice Minister Michael Keenan talked about how Bitcoin has become a household name in exchanges around the world: “Bitcoin, which can be traded anonymously and is as good as cash, is traded now on most significant international exchanges.” \nThe aforementioned report follows new legislation that altcoins must submit to the same disclosure laws as banks and the more traditional exchanges. Another relevant incident had been the charges made against the Commonwealth Bank of Australia over widespread violations of anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing laws. \nThe report further conveyed the rise in money laundering via online betting websites, a large number of which are owned by global crime syndicates. Tabocorp, the largest betting firm in Australia, was fined $35 million for anti-money laundering violations earlier this year. \nDrugs, however, are still the kings of the criminal castle despite ACIC’s considerable accusations, followed by credit card fraud and identity theft, industries which are estimated to be worth $411 million and $1.74 billion respectively. \nRecently, a connection between cryptocurrencies and human trafficking was also established. As Bitcoin offers anonymity, there is an added difficulty in deciphering whether an advertisement is promoting consenting sex workers or victims coerced into slavery. ",

      "text": "Cyber crime suspects (l-r) Dmitry Dokuchayev, Alexei Belan and Igor Sushchin. Photo: FBI President Donald Trump may be keen to improve relations with Moscow but that has not deterred the US authorities from arresting more Russians for suspected cyber hacking than ever before. S\nThe United States has arrested or indicted seven Russians on U.S. cyber crime charges in 2017. On average, just two Russian cyber criminals were extradited to the United States each year between 2010 and the start of this year.\nBelow is a breakdown of the arrests and indictments so far this year:\nRussian computer programmer Stanislav Lisov at a court hearing in Madrid, Thursday, July 20, 2017, regarding a request for his extradition to the US. Luca Piergiovanni / AP STANISLAV LISOV\nArrested in Spain on Jan. 13, aged 32.\nLisov, also known by hacker names \"Black\" and \"Blackf\", according to court documents, is accused of creating the \"NeverQuest\" banking trojan which targeted customers of financial institutions around the world and caused millions of dollars of damage.\nA Spanish court agreed to extradite Lisov to the United States in early August, where he faces up to 35 years in prison. Lisov's lawyer opposed the extradition, arguing that the allegations and evidence against him were too vague, that the United States did not have jurisdiction over any of the alleged crimes.\nIGOR SUSHCHIN\nIndicted on March 15, aged 43.\nOne of two officers from Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) charged by the United States in March with masterminding the 2014 theft of up to 500 million Yahoo accounts, the first time the U.S. government criminally charged Russian spies for cyber offences. Reuters was unable to reach Sushchin for comment.\nDMITRY DOKUCHAYEV\nIndicted on March 15, aged 33.\nThe second FSB officer indicted in the Yahoo hack and Sushchin's subordinate. Allegedly a former hacker who stole and sold credit card details under the online alias \"Forb\", Dokuchayev was one of four men detained on mysterious treason charges by Russian authorities in late 2016. He is currently being held in Moscow. Reuters was unable to reach Dokuchayev for comment.\nALEXEI BELAN\nIndicted on March 15, aged 29.\nOne of two hackers accused of working with Sushchin and Dokuchayev to break into Yahoo email servers and steal data from up to 500 million user accounts. Belan has spent years on the FBI's most-wanted list for crimes. He was arrested in Europe in June 2013 but escaped to Russia before he could be extradited to the United States. Reuters was unable to reach Belan for comment.\nPETER LEVASHOV\nArrested in Spain on April 7, aged 36.\nA spammer accused by U.S. prosecutors of operating a botnet, or network, of tens of thousands of infected computers used by cyber criminals to pump out spam emails. Levashov has been accused of using the botnet for a multitude of criminal schemes, such as stock fraud, online credential phishing attempts and the distribution of malware, including ransomware. He is being held in Spain awaiting extradition to the United States, where he faces up to 52 years in jail. He denies the charges against him.\nYURY MARTYSHEV\nArrested in Latvia on April 26, aged 35\nAccused of helping run a service that let cyber criminals test-drive malware before attacking victims. His extradition to the United States was denounced by the Russian government as \"another case of kidnapping of a Russian citizen by the US authorities.\" Martyshev denies the charges against him, according to Russian media reports.\nAlexander Vinnik, a Russian suspected of running a money laundering operation,on his way to court in Thessaloniki, Greece on July 26, 2017. Alexandros Avramidis/Reuters ALEXANDER VINNIK\nArrested in Greece on July 25, aged 37\nVinnik is accused of laundering at least $4 billion in criminal funds through the BTC-e crytpo-currency exchange since 2011. This is alleged to be part of a scheme to facilitate crimes including computer hacking, fraud and drug trafficking.\nU.S. authorities also linked him to the failure of Mt. Gox, a Japan-based bitcoin exchange that collapsed in 2014 after being hacked.\nHe is being held in Greece awaiting extradition to the United States, where he faces up to 55 years in jail. He denies the charges against him, according to Greek media reports.\n(Reporting by Jack Stubbs in Moscow and Erich Auchard in Frankfurt, Editing by Timothy Heritage)",

PHOTOS: Shutterstock Share via E-Mail Invest early and prudently and consign your worm-catching worries to the scrapheap of post-retirement bliss. PHOTOS: Shutterstock \nWorking towards your dream home or dream wedding involves careful planning – financial, logistical – and more. If meticulous, early planning is the norm for these major milestones, why is it often overlooked for one of life’s most important milestones – retirement? \nWhile it’s true that You Only Live Once, living (and spending) to the max may make you regret your impulse-driven decisions later in life – like that limited-edition, diamond-encrusted timepiece or that tattoo of your ex who swore you’d be “together 4eva”. \nIf you’re a young charger debating whether you should add to your collection of blingworthy watches (or cringeworthy tattoos) or putting your money into an investment portfolio, here are five reasons why the latter could be a better choice. \n1. You’re young, take more (controlled) risks! Advertisement Advertisement \nYes, that luxury watch could retain or appreciate in value, but so could your raft of investments. And since you have time on your side; you could even take a bit more risk, as long as it’s carefully managed. If a world leader’s latest Twitter storm causes market uncertainty, you might still have time to recover your losses. \nBonds and equities exist on the opposite ends of the risk spectrum – the former is usually less risky than the latter. The good news is that a happy middle ground exists where you can generate stable income – multi-asset income solutions. \nThese offer dynamic allocation between lower risk income-yielding securities and higher-risk assets that generate capital gains. This evens out the risks and sources of returns in your investment, which can be more resilient to volatility in the market. A fancy watch and the latest gadgets may make you feel like a player, but multi-asset income solutions will keep you in the game long-term. \n2. Keep your eye on the prize \nRemember when you were 10 years old and you’d save your allowance to buy that awesome video game? Now think bigger and longer-term. Wouldn’t it be nice to have enough to cover life’s little emergencies and still afford the finer things in life after you retire? An annual vacation to the Maldives? Why not? \nStarting your investment early allows you to develop disciplined spending habits by focusing on your budget and cutting unnecessary expenses. Your ultimate goal is to have enough money to enjoy the retirement lifestyle you want. Investing early gives you more capital for future financial planning and helps you focus on long-term needs. What you want now may not be what you need later, so why not save for that ultimate prize? \n3. Who doesn’t want to be in the lead? From little acorns do mighty oaks grow – invest early to boost your chances of having healthy post-retirement finances. \nIf you’re kicking yourself for not jumping on the Bitcoin bandwagon in its infancy, then you now know what it’s like to miss out on that first-mover advantage. The same applies to investing: The early bird gets the worm is an idiom worth remembering. The earlier you begin investing, the rosier your personal financial situation could be down the line. \nCompared to your friends who may have chosen to invest later in life, you will be able to afford things that they can’t over time. Better yet, you may even be able to spend your retirement doing just that: Staying retired instead of working part-time to supplement your retirement savings. \n4. Enjoying life’s luxuries, big and small \nEver thought of embarking on a three-month holiday in Europe after you retire? Start building your nest egg too late though, and even enjoying life’s little luxuries – like a quick getaway to Bali or the avocado toast from your favourite cafe – can become a challenge when you stop working. Putting aside money now so it can work harder for you is a crucial step towards your ideal life in retirement. \n5. Make your money work for you Investing early in products that provide a steady stream of income could give you a relatively worry-free retirement. \nAre your parents always going on about the importance of hard work and how it’s the only way you’ll be able to get ahead in life? We’d never disrespect sage advice from mum and dad, but would like to suggest something that could make your life a little easier: Make your money do some of the heavy lifting. \nTightening your belt now and allocating some money to investments could alleviate the pain of living pay cheque to pay cheque. If the money you’ve invested is earning a higher rate of return than your savings account – especially in the current low-interest rate environment – you will be earning more money over the long term and within a faster period. \nDon’t forget about the power of compounding (interest, not problems). Re-investing your income from investments over the long term helps you build capital and create a sizeable pot that will allow you to more easily reach your objectives down the road. This return on your investments can be used toward major financial goals, such as buying your first home, or simply having enough set aside to enjoy the kind of retirement you’ve worked so hard to achieve.

      "text": "Share Tweet Email FILE PHOTO: Alexander Vinnik, a 38 year old Russian man (L) suspected of running a money laundering operation, is escorted by a plain-clothes police officer to a court in Thessaloniki, Greece July 26, 2017. PHOTO: REUTERS \nWhen Alexander Vinnik was arrested on money-laundering charges at a Greek hotel in late July, the status of his Jabber secure online messaging account was set to “away”. \n“He often takes some time to reply, so at first I didn’t think anything of it,” said one person who knew the Russian as an administrator of a digital currency exchange which US prosecutors say was used to launder criminal funds. \n“Then when I saw his picture on the news, I knew he would be ’away’ for a long time,” said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity. \nVPN provider Hotspot Shield accused of violating user privacy \nThe US Justice Department says Vinnik facilitated crimes including computer hacking, fraud and drug trafficking by laundering at least $4 billion through BTC-e — an exchange used to trade bitcoin and other digital currencies — since 2011. \nThe 37-year-old faces up to 55 years in prison if extradited to the United States. He denies the allegations against him, according to Greek media reports, and BTC-e has said he never worked for the exchange. Reuters was unable to reach BTC-e or a lawyer representing Vinnik for comment. \nVinnik is now one of seven Russians arrested or indicted on US cyber crime charges this year. On average, just two Russian cyber criminals were extradited to the United States each year between 2010 and the start of this year, according to a Reuters review of US Justice Department filings, Russian government statements and sources briefed on the matter. \nThe increase to a record level shows that although President Donald Trump is trying to improve relations with Moscow, the United States has not shied away from pursuing Russians suspected of cyber crime. \nThe prosecutions coincide with intensified scrutiny of Russian hackers since US intelligence officials determined that Russia interfered in the 2016 US presidential election using cyber warfare methods to help Trump. \nThe Kremlin has denied accusations it interfered in elections in the United States or elsewhere.ve questioned whether Trump is willing to respond forcefully to Moscow over its actions in cyberspace, and the White House has avoided publicly accusing Russia \nI’ve questioned whether Trump is willing to respond forcefully to Moscow over its actions in cyberspace, and the White House has avoided publicly accusing Russia over recent politically-motivated hacking attacks. \nAlarmed by Trump’s proposal to create a joint US-Russia cyber security unit, US lawmakers have also drawn up a draft bill that would require him to notify lawmakers before he does so. \nFour US federal law enforcement officials, who discussed the recent arrests with Reuters on condition of anonymity, said there had been no centralized effort to step up action against Russian cyber criminals under Trump. \nThe increase in the number of arrests stemmed from breakthroughs made in investigations before last year’s election, two of them said. \nThe FBI referred all questions to the US Justice Department. The Justice Department said it did not track arrests or indictments by nationality and declined further comment. \nRUSSIAN HACKERS RATTLED \nSome US officials, however, acknowledged that individual agents may now be more motivated to move against Russian cyber criminals following the election hacking scandal. \nRussian hackers are active at all levels of cyber crime, from small-time thefts of online banking details to taking down the computer networks of multinational companies and government departments. \nJohn Carlin, who until last October ran the national security division of the US Justice Department as assistant attorney general, said resources had already been moving towards pursuing Russian nationals before the 2016 election. \nBut he added: “Their outrageous activity to undermine the integrity of our election like they did in western Europe before and have done since can only have added fuel to the fire.” \nAccording to interviews with five people who knew the men arrested this year — all of whom declined to be named for fear of prosecution — the arrests have shaken the Russian cyber crime community. \n“Now they are arresting even those who had a super indirect, not even direct connection to what they call influencing their election,” said one who knew Vinnik by his online moniker WME. \nUsed to operating across borders with relative impunity, Russian cyber criminals are now worried the prosecutions will lead to further arrests or harm their operations. \nThey are cutting back on trips abroad that were once seen as a calculated risk because of the risk of arrest and extradition, but are now viewed as increasingly foolhardy. \n“We have monitored criminals discussing the aftermath (of the arrests) … and it is clear they are concerned about two things,” said Ilya Sachkov, head of cyber security firm Group-IB, whose Threat Intelligence unit specializes in monitoring and tracking the Russian-speaking cyber crime community. \nCanadian accused in Yahoo hack pleads not guilty in US court \n“First, what the arrested members potentially know about them, but second and more importantly, a disruption in their ability to make money.” \nOne of those arrested this year was Peter Levashov, charged by US prosecutors with operating one of the world’s largest botnets, or networks, of infected computers used by cyber criminals. He denies the charges. \nLevashov allegedly used the botnet to pump out spam emails for a multitude of criminal schemes, such as stock fraud, online credential phishing attempts and the distribution of malware, including ransomware. \nA person who knew Levashov by his online identity Severa said his arrest, in particular, had rattled underground cyber criminal circles because he was so well known. \n“People read the news of course and see guys they know getting busted,” the person said. “Once is bad, this many times is scary.”",

      "text": "Register Sign In Users Recommend Hminers Mining Rigs for Fast and Guaranteed ROI Hminers, a trusted manufacturer of cryptocurrency mining products, has recently hit the headlines with their three multi-algorithm mining rigs. Numerous users have already recommended these products for a guaranteed return on investment within less than a month. August 25, 2017 10:51 ET | Source: HMiners Technologies Inc \nMIAMI, Aug. 25, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hminers continues to strengthen their position in the rapidly growing global industry for cryptocurrencies, with their advanced range of mining rigs. Within a relatively short lifespan in the highly competitive market, three extremely efficient mining rigs from the company have received a promising response from several users. These users suggest that the mining rigs from www.Hminers.com have provided them fast and guaranteed return on their investment. \nEver since its emergence, cryptocurrencies have brought about a paradigm shift in technology that promises to redefine the concept of commerce and payment mechanisms. Cryptocurrency mining is an integral part of this system that refers to a highly technical process by which new cryptocurrencies are created. In addition to cryptography experts, many common people are now showing an inclination towards cryptocurrency mining as a lucrative business avenue. However, unfortunately, the return on investment offered by most of the mining rigs has been rather disappointing. \nHminers is a team of industry experts passionate about pursuing excellence in the field of blockchain technology. In the past, Hminers has earned the distinction of coming up with the world’s first 10 nm ASIC Chip. Following the same tradition, the company’s three mining rigs H2U Miner, H4U Miner, and Rack Equipped with 5 x H4U are now offering users a guaranteed return on their investment within just one month. \nHighlighting his experience with the H4U Miner, a delighted user mentioned, “I was surprised to find out that this miner actually helped me break-even, and start earning profits within a month. I have tried out several other mining rigs prior to this one, and the performance of the H4U Miner has been superior to all of them. This product also helps maximize profits by mining Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, or Dash as per user preference.” \nThe heart of the advanced mining rigs from Hminers lies within their high hash power rate that makes them the strongest mining rigs available on the market. While designing these products, Hminers has also addressed the common problem of high electric power consumption. Unlike many other products, these mining rigs are built and designed to operate under multiple algorithms, and generate minimum noise and heat during the process of mining. \n“While designing our mining rigs, it was our utmost priority to make cryptocurrency mining more lucrative for the users by ensuring the best possible return on investment for them within the least possible time,” said the CTO of Hminers, Benjamin Berglung. “The feedback from the users certainly indicates that our efforts have not been wasted.” \nTo find out more about the new Hminers Mining Rigs, please visit https://hminers.com/products/ \nAbout Hminers: Hminers is the most recognizable companies in the cryptocurrency industry and the proud creators of the world’s first 10 nm ASIC Chip. The core team of this organization comprises of top level specialists from globally renowned organizations such as IBM, Microsoft, and Samsung.

      "text": "Transcript: Gary Cohn on tax reform and Charlottesville (FT) “I have come under enormous pressure both to resign and to remain in my current position. As a patriotic American, I am reluctant to leave my post as director of the National Economic Council because I feel a duty to fulfil my commitment to work on behalf of the American people. But I also feel compelled to voice my distress over the events of the last two weeks. Citizens standing up for equality and freedom can never be equated with white supremacists, neo-Nazis, and the KKK. I believe this administration can and must do better in consistently and unequivocally condemning these groups and do everything we can to heal the deep divisions that exist in our communities. As a Jewish American, I will not allow neo-Nazis ranting “Jews will not replace us” to cause this Jew to leave his job.” \nSoftBank’s $100bn Vision Fund needs Wall St trader to come good (FT) Rajeev Misra liked to puff cigars at Deutsche Bank. Subordinates would have to remove smoke detectors from the ceilings. In these heady days before the financial crisis, Mr Misra, as head of fixed income, recruited traders such as Greg Lippmann, later played by Ryan Gosling in The Big Short. They made gigantic bets. Losses of $100m piled up in one book in 2006, enough for those responsible to be fired at any other institution, but they were kept around and made much bigger profits. Today Mr Misra, 55, is leading a very different enterprise with a similar disregard for norms. \nYounger, Cheaper, Smaller, Smarter: Meet the New Breed of Quants (II) A growing number of entrepreneurs schooled in AI see a model ripe for disruption. After all, they have no legacy business to protect. Experts anticipate that these entrepreneurs, armed with computers taught to do the work of expensive and moody humans, will first make inroads with a lower-cost product covering the most efficient parts of the market. Large-cap equities managers, watch out. \nJackson Hole Dark Side Stab (Macro Tourist) If there was to be a surprise at today’s Jackson Hole symposium, I doubt it would be that either Draghi or Yellen tries to get out ahead of this dovishness by signaling even easier policy. No, a surprise will most likely look like a Central Bank chief that attempts to put policy back on the previous tighter path. Most likely they will both duck and try to not disrupt the markets. But there is a better chance than the market is anticipating that one of them (or maybe both of them) surprises with a hawkish statement. SEE ALSO: Jackson Hole Bingo \nRapper Cancels Shows After Saying He Didn’t Need Eclipse Glasses (HuffPo) “Am I crazy for watching the eclipse today [with] no glasses?” Joey Bada$$ tweeted on Monday. “I’ve sungazed before and afterwards saw colors for a whole day. I didn’t die tho (sic).” He went on to argue, “This ain’t the first solar eclipse and I’m pretty sure our ancestors ain’t have no fancy eyewear. Also pretty sure they ain’t all go blind.” Fast forward to Tuesday, and the hip-hop artist announced the cancellations of shows in Cleveland, Chicago and Toronto “due to unforeseen circumstances.” \nThe Bitcoin Sovereign Wealth Fund (Gadfly) A proposal by Estonia’s agency in charge of “e-residency” applications (more on this later) has suggested raising money by selling “estcoins” to the public.The wealth could then be managed via a public-private partnership; a chunk might be poured into venture capital to support domestic start-ups. Holders of estcoins would have a stake in the fund and a say in how it is run. The tokens might then become a viable currency, so the thinking goes, paying for goods and services in a euro-zone country. \nValeant’s Latest Litigation Threat Could Be Especially Costly (BBG) By invoking the RICO law in New Jersey, the location of Valeant’s U.S. headquarters, Lord Abbett could seek a penalty three times as large as the losses it allegedly sustained from the decline in Valeant’s share price. Federal securities laws don’t allow investors to invoke national RICO laws in comparable shareholder suits. \nTwo Bankers Indicted in Libor-Manipulation Case (WSJ) The U.S. Justice Department accused Danielle Sindzingre and Muriel Bescond of instructing their subordinates to submit inaccurately low figures that were then used to calculate Libor, according to Thursday’s indictment in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn. The actions, which are alleged to have happened between May 2010 and October 2011, caused more than $170 million in harm to global financial markets because the false information affected transactions tied to Libor, according to the indictment. \nVanguard Group is America’s new landlord (Philly.com) Securities and Exchange Commission reports compiled by Bloomberg show that the company’s mutual funds and exchange-traded funds are now the leading owners of real estate investment trusts (REITs), the tax-protected investor funds that own many of the nation’s offices, shopping centers, apartments, hotels, warehouses, and data and storage centers. \nThere’s a world championship for Excel spreadsheets (AP) Dumoulin was a bit taken aback when he saw how seriously the international competitors approached the tournament. No American has won the Excel competition in 16 years, though they have won on other Microsoft Office products including Word and PowerPoint. “Some of the foreign countries, they’ve been training for hours and hours and hours on end,” he said. “When you first meet the international students, everyone’s friendly, but when they find out you’re competing against them in the same category, they get this fire in their eyes.” Shares 2",

      "text": "modum.io announces its ITO starting September 1st, 2017 By InsideBitcoins Aug 25, 2017 1:59 PM EDT \nThe MOD Token is backed by a regulatory-driven business case for blockchain technology in the pharma supply chain. \nZurich, Switzerland – August 24, 2017 – On September 1st, 2017 the MOD token is officially available in public crowdsale. In a private pre-sale, the token raised more than 1.25 Million USD for the innovative Swiss start-up, pioneering the use of blockchain and IoT technologies in the pharma supply chain. This week modum has announced a strategic collaboration with IOTA, starting with the acceptance of the IOTA token in the MOD crowdsale. \n— Blockchain technology has the potential to create new foundations for global businesses.[1] While most investors have seen interesting applications in fintech, modum.io is one of the few start-ups focused on the 8.1 trillion USD global logistics market.[2] \nmodum.io has developed sensor devices, which record the environmental conditions that a package has been exposed to while in transit. A sender can pre-program parameters into the blockchain, which enable notifications if a deviation in conditions that may affect the quality of the product has occurred. The records are immutable and auditable, fulfilling regulatory requirements. This passive monitoring strategy reduces the need for costly and inefficient actively-cooled transport solutions with a potential industry wide savings of 3 billion EUR per annum. \nMOD Tokens are backed by the business value of modum.io AG. The recently modified EU GDP regulation requires that pharma producers and the over 10’000 distributors deliver evidence that temperatures did not affect drugs in transit. [3][4] This use case is an early application of blockchain technology in the logistics sector where a real, regulatory-driven market need for the technology exists. \nAfter a successful first year of operations, modum.io AG announced its ITO in early August: 20.1 million MOD tokens will be available in a public crowdsale, each token coming with profit sharing and voting rights at established milestones to align the modum team with token holder interests. \nmodum.io’s CEO, Malik El Bay, explains: “We have a solid product with several successful pilot tests completed, a working hardware prototype, a strong team of developers, and a handpicked team of advisors. We are running this token sale to fundraise for the future development of modum.io and will give our cryptocurrency backers the same rights that institutionalized investors have.” \nRecently, on August 21 st , 2017, modum.io announced the start of a long-term strategic collaboration with IOTA by integrating IOTA tokens as an investment possibility in the MOD Token sale. According to El Bay: “To execute our vision we need a technology for our sensor devices that allows the transfer of value without charging tremendous transaction fees. IOTA’s infrastructure will be very valuable to us and are working towards a proof-of-concept for our next industry tests. We plan to publish the results by fall 2017.” \nDominik Schiener, Co-Founder of the IOTA Foundation, won the Shanghai Blockchain competition with a supply chain application. According to Schiener: “It is great to see an IoT and Blockchain company, with a clear go-to market strategy, thinking about utilizing the IOTA infrastructure. modum.io is a blockchain enabler and we are eager to be one of the technologies behind the project.” \n— \nThe invite only pre-sale for MOD tokens sold out promptly in its first day on August 11th. The public token sale, with 3 bonus tiers, will start on September 1 st , 2017. \nTo participate in the MOD Token sale visit: modum.io/tokensale To download the modum.io white paper: modum.io/whitepaper Follow us on Twitter: twitter.com/modum_io Chat with us on Slack modum.io/slack \nPress contact email address: mike.taylor@modum.io \nLocated in Zurich, between the “Crypto Valley” in Zug and Basel, a hub for major pharma players, modum.io is well positioned to bring their system to market. modum.io works from Technopark, a well-established centre for tech start-ups and innovation in Switzerland. The company benefits from strategic partnerships with the University of Zurich and the University of St. Gallen and industry partners, including Schaer Pharma, Variosystems, and Lykke Corp. ",

      "text": "Business and Finance daily market ltc NEWS Prediction No Comments \nIn the previous writing related to Litecoin Price development, we mentioned for further gains, a breakout over the $50 is required which even happened in the last 24 hours. The Digital currency was spiking in increase aiming to reach and set a new all-time high record but the catapulting stopped at $54.78. However in the positive note, it had stable ground and hovered over the $50 trending line. \nThe 24 hour trading volume for Litecoin is $619.6, only behind of Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple – Based on CoinmarketCap. Even like in other cases like Monero , ETC , Ripple that last days South Korean trading/exchanging platforms leading with 20.4% leaving behind Chinese ones like OkCoin and Huobi. \nSource Coinmarketcap \nExcept that in general the market relating to different cryptocurrencies has been spiking there is no specific reason for Litecoin surge yesterday. Only adding that the team is working in several significant features to be installed in the platform. The Litecoin community is eagerly anticipating the inclusion of cross-chain atomic swaps between LTC and BTC in the near future. On top of that implementing its own version of the Lightening Network, could dramatically increase transaction speeds. \nMovements like the first to adopt Segregated Witness on the scaling upgrade, have shown how Charile Lee the creator wants to improve the heavily-influenced by the original platform Litecoin. LTC is often even even called “The Silver side of Gold Bitcoin” reflecting how much they are similar. Maybe the community positive energy that results of the hard work for improvement is keeping the digital currency upwards. \nTrading today – the Litecoin price stood at $51.10, as of 15:51 BST. The cryptocurrency has gained 5.10% over the past 24 hours, according to Coinmarketcap. \nRead Also: ",

      "text": "0 Researchers Profile The Australian Bitcoin User \nResearchers have profiled the normative Australian bitcoin user, describing the industry participant’s avatar as under the age of 34, white, male, and living on the eastern seaboard. The research was conducted by bitcoin.com.au and polled approximately 1200 Australians. \nAlso Read: Australia Introduces Bill That Regulates Bitcoin Exchanges The Survey Reveals the Average Australian Bitcoin User to be a White Male Under the Age of 34 Living on the Country’s Eastern Seaboard \nResearch has sought to profile the average user of bitcoin in Australia. The survey reveals that the average Australian bitcoin user is a white male under the age of 34 living on the country’s eastern seaboard. The majority of bitcoin adopters use cryptocurrency for the purpose of investment. \nThe data reinforced a common trend for bitcoin adoption in developed countries, in which population centres with access to financial services seek to utilize bitcoin as an investment vehicle, while those living in areas that lack a high standard for accessing basic economic services fail to engage with the technology – despite the practical benefits offered by cryptocurrency’s utility. \nThe research was undertaken during July, and polled approximately 1200 Australians involved in the bitcoin economy as either participants or observers. The vast majority of survey participants owned less than 1 bitcoin (70 percent), with only 3 per cent of participants owning more than 25 bitcoins. Less than 10 percent of participants reported engaging in bitcoin transactions daily. Users cited transaction privacy, decentralization, and the fluidity of transnational transactions as the principle appeals of bitcoin. Seeking to reflect global estimates of female bitcoin adoption, only 10 percent of participants were women. The Rising Costs Associated With Bitcoin Transactions Are Not Cited as a Major Concern by Australia’s Bitcoin Community \nThe rising costs associated with bitcoin transactions are not cited as comprising a significant concern to Australia’s bitcoin community. The lack of concern regarding fees likely owes to bitcoin’s dominant use as a means for investment, rather than for its utility as a means of value circulation. \nSurvey participants were also polled regarding what they view as the major risks of cryptocurrency. Half of survey participants cited the risk of hacking or theft as the principal risk associated with bitcoin, whilst only 5 percent of users cited issues pertaining to anonymity as a major concern. \nDo you think that the demographic profile presented by bitcoin.com.au’s researchers comprises an accurate reflection of the normative cryptocurrency user in a developed country?

      "text": "By NYN Daily \nFROM NEW YORK NONPROFIT MEDIA: *     for an Insights podcast   \n\nTOP NEWS: * In a city known for its racial and ethnic diversity, the percentage of people of color serving on museum and arts groups’ boards remains strikingly low and some elite groups employ overwhelmingly white staffs even as they try to attract a broad cross-section of visitors, according to data collected by The New York Times. \n* New York City Councilman David Greenfield has a plan to take the politics out of locating homeless shelters, and will introduce a bill on Thursday to create an independent commission to decide where new ones should be built, the Daily News writes. * NonProfit Pro offers advice on how to close the yawning gender gap in volunteering to help nonprofits. \n*Education officials plan to reduce funding directed to the city’s 23 Young Adult Borough Centers by an average of $254,000 each, and will shift the money to transfer schools, which also help students who have fallen behind in traditional schools, Chalkbeat reports. \n* Success Academy Charter Schools’ new state test scores were so good, students across the network outperformed every district in New York state on the annual grades 3-8 exams, The 74 reports. \n* New test scores show that public charter schools are the best public schools in the city for high-need students, so Mayor de Blasio should give charters the space they need.and approve the 27 space requests on his desk, The New York Post shares in an editorial. *In her new memoir, Eva Moskowitz presents herself to a national audience as a virtuous troublemaker hellbent on disrupting the status quo of public education — a sort of “Art of the Deal” for education reform, complete with an enemies list even the president could appreciate, Politico reports. * New York University’s Tandon School of Engineering announced that a team of university researchers has devised the first automated techniques to identify ads potentially tied to human trafficking rings and link them to public information from Bitcoin in a first step toward developing a suite of freely available tools to help police and nonprofit institutions identify victims of sexual exploitation. * Organizers at Hope Community Services on Washington Avenue in New Rochelle said an estimated $10,000 worth of backpacks, calculators and other donated supplies were taken during a break in Monday night, CBS NewYork reports. \n\nFOCUS ON HEALTH CARE: \n* The Commonwealth Fund recently released a study using data from the federal Consumer Expenditure Survey to examine how states’ participation in the Medicaid expansion affected families’ health care spending. \n* New York City, Connecticut and Massachusetts are replicating a Rhode Island program that sends recovery coaches to hospital emergency rooms to meet overdose survivors and offer support, Oakland Press reports. \n\n\nKPIs and Dashboards – A Nonprofit Gamechanger \nVisibility and transparency are paramount to your nonprofits’ success. Everyone from program managers to board members need insight into different aspects of financial data to make the right decisions. Choosing the right KPIs and dashboards can be game-changing. Download this free guide to nonprofit dashboards today. \nFor over 25 years, JMT has been helping nonprofits achieve sustainability and mission effectiveness. Learn more about JMT Consulting . \n\n\nTRUMP ADMINISTRATION: \n* In a piece by The New York Times , concerns about the Trump Administration’s move to undo the shift in funding for sex education to focus on evidence-based outcomes, are analyzed - considering sex education focused on an abstinence-only approach often fails. \n* Trump’s immigration order revived a decades-old program which trains local law enforcement officials in immigration enforcement and deputizes them with federal authority making school resource officers a possible conduit for protected personal information about students and their families, such as undocumented status, The Guardian reports. \n\nIN DEPTH: \n* When nonprofits dole out grant money to peers, the result is a transformative experience that fosters innovation, collaboration, and learning, The Stanford Social Innovation Review writes. \n\n\nAt the Center of Social Impact \nExplore non-degree programs in social enterprise at Columbia Business School Executive Education and find yourself at the center of social impact. \n\n\nNONPROFITS IN THE NEWS: \n* Lapa Fundraising’s blog features an interview with Jill Mendelson of UJA-Federation of New York on her views of our “high-profit” sector, its challenges and opportunities, what’s she’s learned over these many years, the accomplishments she’s most proud of, and what continues to inspire her. \n* Code2040’s fellows program has paired black and Latinx students with internships at key Silicon Valley players like Slack, Airbnb, Intel, and Twitter and starting next year, Code2040 is bringing the program to New York City, Fast Company reports. \n\nNYN BUZZ: \n* The Associated Medical Schools of New York (AMSNY) has announced the 10 recipients of the new Diversity in Medicine Scholarship program. The scholarship program was funded this year by the New York State Department of Health with the support of the legislature, to help address the gap in physician diversity. Data shows that patients who have doctors who represent their own diversity have better medical experiences.

      "text": "LTCUSD Technical Analysis for 08/25/2017 – Pullback Opportunities livebitcoinnews.com Published 4 hours ago by Sara Jenn #trading #litecoin #ltcusd \nPrice is in the middle of a pullback from its recent rally and is currently testing support at the 50% Fibonacci retracement level. If this level keeps losses in check, LTCUSD could resume its climb to the swing high around $55.50. \nLitecoin is giving up its gains from the bitcoin price drop earlier in the week as the latter is regaining bullish traction following the activation of SegWit. There have been doubts about this upgrade as rival version bitcoin cash gained more mining power in the past few days, attracting investor demand as well. \nAny indication that the upgrade went by without a hitch could push bitcoin back to its record highs or higher, which could force the competition including LTCUSD to retreat. On the other hand, complications surrounding the hard fork and upgrade could spur stronger demand for alternative cryptocurrencies. \nCautious remarks could douse rate hike hopes for December or September, which could be dollar bearish and bullish for litecoin. On the other hand, hawkish hints could drive the dollar higher across the board. Coin spectator is an automated news aggregation service. All copyrights belong to their respective owners.

      "text": "James Dines, writing in the Aug. 11, 2017, issue of The Dines Letter, notes a sale of Zynerba Pharmaceuticals Inc. at $14 (all figures U.S.). He recommended buying the stock on Feb. 3, 2017, at $17.88. Assuming an investment of $1,000, selling the investment at $14 would result in a loss of $216. Zynerba was among the editor's marijuana picks, a list Mr. Dines says he is going through carefully. He says he is weeding out the less successful stocks before they \"go up in smoke.\" New marijuana companies are shaky, he notes, and not all of them will survive. Elsewhere in the newsletter, Mr. Dines says he has long warned that the world's currencies are unstable because they can be printed without limit. Into this impasse stepped Bitcoin, he says. Bitcoin is comparable with gold because its very value is hinged on limiting the total amount of bits that could ever be mined to 21 million. As with real gold, only a finite supply of Bitcoin exists. Bitcoin has recently birthed a new version of itself, Bitcash. Bitcash, Mr. Dines says, has smaller individual values to allow for faster transactions.\n ",

      "text": "Howard University ’21. I write about math, computer science, technology, and society. http://www.aunyks.com/ Aug 24 The Anatomy of ERC20 What’s on the Inside of Ethereum’s Most Popular Contract In light of today’s ICO launches, digital token sales during which companies and organizations raise millions of dollars instantly while giving out digital assets, it’s important to recognize the underlying technology that nearly all of these tokens possess: ERC20. Ethereum Request for Comments 20, or ERC20, is an Ethereum Improvement Proposal introduced by Fabian Vogelsteller in late 2015. It’s a standard by which many popular Ethereum smart contracts abide. It effectively allows smart contracts to act very similarly to a conventional cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, or Ethereum itself. In saying this, a token hosted on the Ethereum blockchain can be sent, received, checked of its total supply, and checked for the amount that is available on an individual address. This is analogous to sending and receiving Ether or Bitcoin from a wallet, knowing the total amount of coins in circulation, and knowing a particular wallet’s balance of a coin. A smart contract that follows this standard is called an ERC20 token. ERC: 20 Title: Token standard Status: Draft Type: Informational Created: 19-11.2015 Resolution: https://github.com… github.com All of the previously described functionality is able to exist by defining a set of functions that allow a smart contract to emulate a digital token. But how does that work? ERC20 defines the functions balanceOf , totalSupply , transfer , transferFrom , approve , and allowance . It also has a few optional fields like the token name, symbol, and the number of decimal places with which it will be measured. Note: This is a concise declaration of an example ERC20 contract. An overview and example of each field within the contract is as follows. totalSupply() Although the supply could easily be fixed, as it is with Bitcoin, this function allows an instance of the contract to calculate and return the total amount of the token that exists in circulation. balanceOf() This function allows a smart contract to store and return the balance of the provided address. The function accepts an address as a parameter, so it should be known that the balance of any address is public. approve() When calling this function, the owner of the contract authorizes, or approves , the given address to withdraw instances of the token from the owner’s address. Here, and in later snippets, you may see a variable msg . This is an implicit field provided by external applications such as wallets so that they can better interact with the contract. The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) lets us use this field to store and process data given by the external application. In this example, msg.sender is the address of the contract owner. transfer() This function lets the owner of the contract send a given amount of the token to another address just like a conventional cryptocurrency transaction. transferFrom() This function allows a smart contract to automate the transfer process and send a given amount of the token on behalf of the owner. Seeing this might raise a few eyebrows. One may question why we need both transfer() and transferFrom() functions. Consider transferring money to pay a bill. It’s extremely common to send money manually by taking the time to write a check and mail it to pay the bill off. This is like using transfer() : you’re doing the money transfer process yourself, without the help of another party. In another situation, you could set up automatic bill pay with your bank. This is like using transferFrom() : your bank’s machines send money to pay off the bill on your behalf, automatically. With this function, a contract can send a certain amount of the token to another address on your behalf, without your intervention. Token Name This is an optional field, but many popular tokens include it so that popular wallets like Mist and MyEtherWallet are able to identify them. contract MyERCToken { string public constant name = \"My Custom ERC20 Token\"; } Token Symbol Another optional field used to identify a token, this is a three or four letter abbreviation of the token, just like BTC, ETH, AUG, or SJCX. contract MyERCToken { string public constant symbol = \"MET\"; } Number of Decimals An optional field used to determine to what decimal place the amount of the token will be calculated. The most common number of decimals to consider is 18. contract MyERCToken { uint8 public constant decimals = 18; } The total source code of ERC20 token that we just created can be found here . In the end, the original ERC20 proposal is rather unappreciated. It opened up avenues for a new set of smart contracts that could be created and distributed in the same fashion as Bitcoin or Ethereum. This proves to be very enticing for young companies, as the entire ERC20 ecosystem is hosted on the Ethereum blockchain, a large pre-existing network of computers. This means that developers and young companies don’t have to attract miners in order to sustain their tokens, something that can save a lot of money. And, these tokens can be hosted on exchanges to be traded like other assets, so investors can easily buy and sell these tokens like more popular currencies. ",

      "text": "Altcoin News LO3 NEWS onG.social OSM Storj No Comments \nWhen blockchain technology first entered mainstream as the supporting tech for Bitcoin, it was barely noticed. The vast majority of the public had little experience with it, and the complex programming associated with understanding and using blockchain technology kept people out of the marketplace. The learning curve was just too high. \nHowever, as mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has begun to grow, so has acceptance of the blockchain concept they’re built on. Blockchain technology is starting to be used in many different applications, from messaging to storage. In an era where transparency and security are both valued at a premium, blockchain represents a system where transactions and contracts can be both transparent and completely secure at the same time. \nWhile the learning curve was once steep, new companies are coming into the marketplace, disrupting traditional methods, and creating new user-friendly applications for blockchain. These user-friendly blockchain platforms are making inroads into spaces that have been governed by enterprise-level corporations and may change our everyday routines in big ways. Blockchain and Messaging \nMessaging applications are everywhere. iMessage, Whatsapp, Viber, WeChat, Hike, etc. Recent predictions indicate that as many as 2.2 billion people will access and use messaging apps this year alone. \nThis kind of massive use has created a sort of frenzy in the marketplace, with many new apps coming online. Traditional apps are facing some stiff competition with these new startups, as the new companies offer superior privacy and security, as well as added features. \nOne such company, Obsidian , has created its own blockchain platform and has built an application called Obsidian Secure Messaging (OSM). This app boasts some of the most secure information transfer ability in the world. \nUsers who want to share information or documents with 100% certainty of privacy and security are OSM’s target demographics. While other messenger apps (like Telegram) have been in the news for breaches of privacy and security , OSM has created a blockchain-backed system that ensures only the intended user is able to view content, and even the platform itself cannot view the messages. Additionally, OSM allows users to make payments to each other via its own internal cryptocurrency (ODN), providing a fully secure, anonymous, and private payment method as well. \nThe company is currently conducting an ICO , and aims to continue to develop the platform. It may be that in a short time, all our messaging will flow through blockchain-based apps like OSM, where security and privacy are assured through the auditable blockchain code. Blockchain and Social Media \nSocial media is also undergoing a major overhaul – news of privacy and security issues have driven users away from traditional models. Furthermore, social media networks currently sell user data to advertisers for profit , and make it very difficult for creators to monetize their content apart from ad sales. \nThese issues have led to new social media solutions coming out of the blockchain world. Alongside the already-known Steemit, one company, onG.social, has emerged as a competitor. They have created a social media platform where users are able to upload and share content on a distributed blockchain network, protecting the value of user-created content. \nOther users are able to digitally tip creators of content they like. The network also allows users to link to external centralized social media feeds, providing protection for the data on the decentralized platform while still providing freedom of access. As is the nature of blockchain technology, onG.social doesn’t sell or leverage user data because the entire platform is decentralized in its management. There is not central hub to take profits or leverage users with advertisers. \nJust like messaging, a day may come when social media will be directed to users via blockchain-based portals where security and privacy are paramount. This scenario may well overtake the whole social media world, given its usability and simplicity. Blockchain and Energy \nThe power of blockchain is also being used in the energy field. For example, one company, LO3 , has created a blockchain-based sustainable energy grid for Brooklyn. \nThe system, a community-based micro gird, allows local communities within Brooklyn to create, share, and consume energy in a transparent and secure way. Blockchain technology allows the grid to decentralize and manage energy for times of power outage or for monetization for the good of the community. \nFurthermore, companies like LO3 are building new and intriguing ways to employ local workers. Since the blockchain creates a distributed system, management of the electrical resource producers and maintenance of the system are required, driving jobs back into the local communities. You can read more about LO3 and collaborations between blockchain and energy here . \nCoupled with the IoT, and the connectedness of individual users, the blockchain is creating distributed systems for energy control. These systems are far more efficient and may someday be in every home helping to reduce waste and normalize usage. Blockchain and the Workplace \nBlockchain technology is also creating new and intriguing ways to share data securely in the workspace. New companies like the fast growing Storj have created blockchain systems where users are able to store and manage data securely. \nThe advantage of such a system is obvious. Decentralized storage solutions removes the central point of failure that storage solutions today have, is far more affordable through the use of smart peer-to-peer storage and is completely open source and publicly auditable through the blockchain technology powering it. \nThe system is designed to allow an ecosystem, or a blockchain marketplace to grow and thrive. “Renters” within storage can sell their extra unused storage to others in a competitive decentralized storage marketplace. You can read more about Storj in the context of the power of decentralization here . \nThe advantages are obvious, and systems such as these are growing in number every day. It may well be that the face of business storage and security will forever change through the blockchain. \nLooking over the tech landscape, blockchain will be to this generation what the internet was to the previous generation. Everything is going to change, user friendliness will increase, and systems that refuse to change and adopt the technology may well be left behind. ",

      "text": "The Tap Project – The Ambitious Idea to Unite Gaming Currencies 4 hours ago 56 in bitcoin \nThe Tap Project is a decentralized, transferable, multi-platform in-game cryptocurrency that utilizes the Ethereum network. \nIt was originally going to start a crowdsale on July 30 but decided to push it back to Q4 2017 . \nFirst, I really like the gaming industry as a natural fit for cryptocurrencies. You have both a tech savvy crowd and in-game currencies are already used in most games. \nThe Tap Project is attempting to solve the problem of having to manage all those in-game currencies. \nUsing the Tap Project dashboard you can access all your in-game currencies and evaluate them in a single currency, the Tap Coin (TTT). \nIf it all works as plans then the Tap Coin can follow you to any game or device, your hard work will never be locked up in one game, and you can make money as Tap Coins are tradeable on the exchanges. \nThe Tap Project should benefit developers as well since they’ll be able to focus more on the gaming experience rather than how they will reach their audience. \nThis is a very interesting project. I’m keeping my eye out for details on the upcoming ICO. \nFor more articles on cryptocurrencies follow me @g-dubs . Buy Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin at Coinbase .

The surge was accompanied by a dramatic increase in trading volume, primarily on South Korean exchanges. However, the Ripple price began to sink on Thursday after a much-anticipated announcement did not live up to investor expectations. Ripple Announcement Doesn’t Live Up to Hype \nRipple’s early week rally was partially spurred on by a series of cryptic tweets posted on the official Ripple Twitter page. \nOn Monday, Ripple began a counting down to what appeared to be an ordinary conference announcement. However, rumors had been swirling for some time that Ripple is going to make a major move into the Asian economy, perhaps through a partnership with a major corporation or bank. \nIn this context, people began to read more into the tweets than was really there, anticipating that Ripple was going to make a major announcement that would confirm the thus-far unsubstantiated rumors. \nThe Ripple price soared. Advertisement: \nBut then the announcement came. As perhaps should have been expected, Ripple really was just making a conference announcement. \n— Ripple (@Ripple) August 24, 2017 \n“Swell: The Future Is Here,” as the conference is titled, will take place from October 16-18 in Toronto. One of the keynote speakers will be Ben Bernanke, former chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve System, which helps explain the reference to “banking & blockchain” coming together. \nBased on the comments in the Daily Ripple/XRP discussion thread on Reddit , this was not the announcement community members were hoping for. Ripple Price Sinks 21% in 5 Hours \nThe Ripple price had gradually risen in the hours leading up to the announcement of Swell, but it took a steep downward turn afterward. At 14:00 UTC, the Ripple price was $0.289. Within an hour, it had dropped to $0.262, and it has continued to fall from there. Ripple Price Chart from CoinMarketCap \nAt present, the Ripple price is $0.229, a 21% decrease from its pre-announcement-level. This gives Ripple a market cap of $8.8 billion, which is about $1.4 billion less than 3rd-ranked bitcoin cash. \nFeatured image from Shutterstock. ",

      "text": "Handel elektroniczny Get a Website Built \nI would like to create a secure website that allows for the sales of Zombie Cat Apocalypse, a Graphic Novel which I created. The site must be secure and ecommerce ready. There will be two portals one that leads to wholesale dealer sales and one for the general public($11.95 per). The dealer sales link to the e-commerce must be password protected and will have different pricing. There must be a section where I can put in specials (like free poster or free shipping). In addition I will like the option for the retail buyer to choose to purchase a digital download copy($8.95). The digital copy must be put into downloadable reader form(DRM-Protected) and be readable on Cell phone (Apple and Android Platforms) + Ipads. \nThe website must utilize the graphics from the Graphic Novel. The website creator can use the cover as long as they bring it to life and then make the order buttons for the dealers and general public very visible. Please include the following links on top: Home * Purchase a Copy * Retailers(wholesale) * Contact Us . \nI have uploaded a copy of the cover. My dream is to get people very excited to order, so a stagnant website will not do. I am looking for cutting edge cool and not cookie cutter! \nI imagine the check-out process will do auto shipping prices (Including international to 10 countries or all countries if something stock already exists) USA, China, Japan, Russia, Canada, Spain, Germany, Italy, England, Ireland, South Korea. I would like the option to increase this as I discover new markets. \nThe check out process should allow for Credit Card use, or Paypal, I am flexible to learn of other ways to accept payment but no wire transfer, bitcoin, or checks. The retailers will be allowed to purchase in Minimum case Qty of 25 units. $5.95 ea. Delivered free in Continental US. If they order 5+ cases the price drops to $5.50 ea. (+They get 10 free posters) . Any higher qty they can contact me directly for large volume distribution. \nOnce the order is placed , the shipping is determined and the order is payed I would like a packaging slip email to me to ship out their order. \nI do not want to keep anyone credit card information, however I would like a spreadsheet of all my buyers, separated by general public purchases & Retailers. I would like the retailers to show their Name, Store Name, Phone, email, address , what they purchased and when it was shipped. I also want a running count of how many have been sold and total revenue (Not visible to general Public or Retailers).",

      "text": "German Sterligov, an eccentric Russian entrepreneur, has launched a cryptocurrency exchange named CryptoSterlingClub Alice. Sponsored Links \n“Back in the early nineties, there was an exchange called Alice. It was similar in some way: there was no regular legislation concerning some issues, just like in cryptocurrency nowadays. So, there are some nostalgic references here. We decided to call it Alice once again, and even opened the office [on the same street],” Sterligov told RBC. \nThe entrepreneur stressed that no fees will be involved in transactions. \n“We’re not involved in selling. We don’t have any fees for transactions. Our cost will always be higher than at regular exchanges. That’s because we have live communication, live trading, and there are more buyers than sellers. It’s a platform to make big transactions like buying 5,000 bitcoins at once, which is impossible at regular exchanges,” Sterligov said. \nHowever, he noted, one will have to pay in order to enter the exchange. \nEarlier, Sterligov stated that he decided to get involved in selling bitcoins after hearing Russia’s Vladimir Putin speaking positively about cryptocurrencies.",
